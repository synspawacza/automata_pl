M6120_S0000_G0000_001_resi=Man, this place is AWESOME!
M6120_S0000_G0010_001_resi=You're very popular these days. Lookin' forward to your next efforts!
M6120_S0000_G0020_001_resi=Thanks to you defeating the S Rank champ, he'll be spending his days in jail for a while. Thanks!
M6120_S0010_G0000_001_resi=Would you believe the guys at the top think all of this is illegal? How stupid is that!?
M6120_S0010_G0010_001_resi=I hear you're pretty strong! Maybe I should check out one of your matches some day.
M6120_S0010_G0020_001_resi=Man, you rock at this!
M6120_S0010_G0030_001_resi=Some people make fun of this place, but they're just simple-minded idiots who don't know what fun is. I feel sorry for 'em. Don't you?
M6120_S0020_G0000_001_resi=Hey there. Having fun?
M6120_S0020_G0010_001_resi=You're getting the hang of this place, aren't ya?
M6120_S0020_G0020_001_resi=Hm? You're wondering why this place hasn't been locked down?
M6120_S0020_G0030_001_resi=The higher-ups ain't stupid. They know what we're doing, but they're turnin' a blind eye.
M6120_S0020_G0040_001_resi=They know that if they don't give us a chance to let off steam, we'll end up takin' out our frustations elsewhere.
M6120_S0020_G0050_001_resi=Besides, some of the money we make here goes directly towards the top. That's society for ya.
M6120_S0020_G0060_001_resi=You'd better not poke your nose where it don't belong either, ya hear?
M6120_S0030_G0000_001_resi=Nowadays it's war everywhere you go.\nI need a bit of distraction like this to keep me sane.
M6120_S0030_G0010_001_resi=Watching you pound those machines to shreds is very therapeutic. Hypnotic, almost!
M6120_S0030_G0020_001_resi=Ever since I found out about this place, I've been much more eager to go out and fight. It's awesome!
M6120_S0040_G0000_001_resi=As long as I get my entertainment, I can keep working every day.
M6120_S0040_G0010_001_resi=This place is what's keeping me sane every day.
M6120_S0040_G0020_001_resi=I've never seen anyone destroy machines with so much flair! You're amazing!
M6120_S0050_G0000_001_resi=Got some really good stuff on sale...if you're interested.
M6120_S0050_G0010_001_resi=Looks like I'm gonna have to stock up near that underground cave again.
M6120_S0050_G0020_001_resi=It's been a while since someone cleared the highest rank. You're gonna be a great hunter, I can tell!
M6120_S0060_G0000_001_resi=I'd like to place a new order for 10,000 G.
M6120_S0060_G0010_001_resi=That last one was worthless! It broke down almost instantly! I need a stronger one!
M6120_S0060_G0020_001_resi=Hey, I saw your match! I'm sure you could bring me some really lively ones!
M6120_S0070_G0000_001_resi=Sorry, this place is off-limits.
M6120_S0070_G0020_001_resi=You're not gonna find any better entertainment than this place, lemme tell ya.
M6120_S0080_G0000_001_resi=Dammit! All of my money's gone cause that piece of junk didn't win!
M6120_S0080_G0010_001_resi=YES! I WON! I WON! Look at all this money! I'm rich! Wahahaha!
M6120_S0080_G0020_001_resi=Huh? You wanna know what happened to the other girl?
M6120_S0080_G0030_001_resi=She kept losin' until she ran out of money, then she got dragged off somewhere. Dumb broad.
M6120_S0080_G0040_001_resi=That won't happen to me though! I'm ready for my next big win!
M6120_S0090_G0000_001_resi=Oh man, what am I gonna do now?\nHow am I gonna make that money back!?
M6120_S0100_G0000_001_resi=This place is off-limits except for Colosseum combatants.
M6120_S0100_G0010_001_resi=If you wanna fight, get yourself registered at the reception first.
M6120_S0110_G0000_001_resi=Should I play it safe, or bet big?
M6120_S0110_G0010_001_resi=Oh hey, I saw you fight before! I think I'm gonna bet on you next!
M6120_S0110_G0020_001_resi=Wow, I never thought you'd beat the champ! I should've put my money on you...
M6120_S0110_G0030_001_resi=Next time I'm definitely betting on you, so lemme know when your next match is, 'kay?
M6120_S0120_G0000_001_resi=Come on, you call this a fight!?\nI wanna see bolts flyin' all over the place!
M6120_S0120_G0010_001_resi=What the hell, you can't even beat a broken-ass piece of junk like that!? Loser!
M6120_S0120_G0020_001_resi=Don't stop just cause you already won! Grind him to dust!
M6120_S0130_G0000_001_resi=That's the spirit! Hit 'em where it hurts!
M6120_S0130_G0010_001_resi=OH. MY. GOD. That was the most exciting match I've ever seen!
M6120_S0130_G0020_001_resi=WOOOOOOW! You actually beat the champ!? Un-friggin-believable!
M6120_S0140_G0000_001_resi=It's a wonderful sight, seeing machine bits fly everywhere, isn't it? Makes me feel all peaceful inside.
M6120_S0140_G0010_001_resi=I wonder if there's a word for that.
M6120_S0140_G0020_001_resi=So I checked some human records and apparently the joy of seeing machine bits fly everywhere is called "elation."
M6120_S0140_G0030_001_resi=We lost so many of our troops to these bastards, it's truly...elating to see them get destroyed!
M6120_S0140_G0040_001_resi=Bwahaha! The elation, oh the elation! I'm so elated right now!
M6120_S0150_G0000_001_resi=What are you DOING, you worthless sack of metal!?
M6120_S0150_G0010_001_resi=I've got money ridin' on you! Fight to win!
M6120_S0150_G0020_001_resi=I saw you fight just now. You might be able to take that asshole S Rank champ down!
M6120_S0150_G0030_001_resi=Fantastic! Thanks to you, the former champion has been taken down a notch. He won't be acting so tough anymore now, I bet.
M6120_S0160_G0000_001_resi=Nothing beats front row seats, am I right?
M6120_S0160_G0010_001_resi=Gotta watch out for those stray bullets though, but that's part of the fun!
M6120_S0160_G0020_001_resi=Makes you feel alive!!
M6120_S0160_G0030_001_resi=Not many stray bullets have made their way over here lately...
M6120_S0160_G0040_001_resi=I need to see those beautiful red bubbles coming at me to experience the true thrill of combat!
M6120_S0160_G0060_001_resi=Good job completing the S Rank!
M6120_S0160_G0070_001_resi=You think you could maybe try again and send some bullets my way? Please?
M6120_S0170_G0000_001_resi=You're new here, ain't ya? If you plan on bettin' some money here, you'd better use your head.
M6120_S0170_G0010_001_resi=Some people lose everything they have. They get taken off and are never seen again.
M6120_S0170_G0020_001_resi=You're that android everyone's been talkin' about, huh? You enjoyin' yourself here?
M6120_S0170_G0030_001_resi=This is a place where only the strong survive, so it's not for everyone.
M6120_S0170_G0040_001_resi=I guess we'll see soon enough if us androids are really the strongest ones on this planet, huh?
M6120_S0170_G0050_001_resi=So tell me, what do you think of this place?
M6120_S0170_G0060_001_resi=I don't think you'll disagree that us androids have plenty of reasons to kick the crap outta the machines after all they've done to us, right?
M6120_S0170_G0070_001_resi=That said, most people here don't even care about revenge. They're just here to kill.
M6120_S0170_G0080_001_resi=I'm gettin' the impression they'd slaughter anything put in front of 'em, be it machine or something else.
M6120_S0170_G0090_001_resi=On the other hand, there's lots of people here who gain the energy to keep on livin' every day as well.
M6120_S0170_G0100_001_resi=I dunno whether we're all doin' the right thing, or if we're all just completely deranged...
M6120_S0180_G0000_001_resi=Dammit, I lost again!
M6120_S0180_G0010_001_resi=Maybe I should try becoming a contestant...
M6120_S0180_G0020_001_resi=Owowowowow...
M6120_S0180_G0030_001_resi=Man, I should NOT have tried becoming a contestant!
M6120_S0190_G0000_001_resi=Man, these low-level matches are so boring...
M6120_S0190_G0010_001_resi=I wanna watch the higher level ones, but they're so expensive.
M6120_S0190_G0020_001_resi=You are an absolutely joy to watch in combat, you know that?
M6120_S0190_G0030_001_resi=The tickets for high rank matches may be expensive, but wow, you do get your money's worth!
M6120_S0190_G0040_001_resi=Even the excitement of high rank matches starts wearing off after a while. It's funny how the mind works.
M6120_S0190_G0050_001_resi=Androids must be starving for entertainment more than I thought.
M6120_S0200_G0000_001_resi=The S Rank champion is super strong. He's won 90 matches in a row!
M6120_S0200_G0010_001_resi=Whenever he has a match, tickets get sold out in no time.
M6120_S0200_G0020_001_resi=I saw you fight before. You're pretty good.
M6120_S0200_G0030_001_resi=In the meanwhile, the champion has won 96 matches in a row though.
M6120_S0200_G0040_001_resi=The question now is: will he reach 100, or are you going to stop him?
M6120_S0200_G0050_001_resi=Looks like you took down the champ, huh?
M6120_S0200_G0060_001_resi=I was sure he was gonna get 100 victories and escape this place, but there you go...
M6120_S0200_G0070_001_resi=Just goes to show that no one can escape their destiny, be they android or machine.
M6120_S0210_G0000_001_resi=Ugh... I'm just shit outta luck today.
M6120_S0210_G0010_001_resi=I've been on a winning streak! Luck's finally on my side!
M6120_S0210_G0020_001_resi=Luck's a strange thing. You can't go against it, but you can somehow channel it if you really try.
M6120_S0210_G0030_001_resi=So you beat the champion, huh? I thought fortune was on his side for sure...
M6120_S0210_G0040_001_resi=Well, looks like you were lucky, and he wasn't. End of story.
M6120_S0220_G0000_001_resi=GRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!
M6120_S0220_G0010_001_resi=Phew, feels good to flex your lungs sometimes!
M6120_S0220_G0020_001_resi=GRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!
M6120_S0220_G0030_001_resi=I just can't stop shouting! Wanna join in?
M6120_S0220_G0040_001_resi=...Too...much...shouting... Vocal...cords...busted...
M6120_S0230_G0000_001_n02=Excuse me, I have a favor to ask of you.
M6120_S0230_G0010_001_n02=I'm just a feeble machine, and there's no way out of this hell for me.
M6120_S0230_G0020_001_n02=So would you mind killing me, please?
M6120_S0230_G0030_001_n02=My family is gone, and I have nothing left of value.
M6120_S0230_G0040_001_n02=I'm tired of having to live through the same nightmare every day.
M6120_S0230_G0050_001_n02=I know this might not sit very well with you...
M6120_S0230_G0060_001_n02=But...could you kill me... Please?

M6120_S0240_G0010_001_toolshop=What, ya godda problem with the way I talk?
