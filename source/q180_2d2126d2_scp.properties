M5180_S0010_G0000_001_a9s=Um, Operator? What are you doing?
M5180_S0010_G0010_001_op210=What am I doing? I am analyzing data.
M5180_S0010_G0020_001_a9s=Is this part of your current assignment?
M5180_S0010_G0030_001_op210=No, it is merely a hobby.
M5180_S0010_G0040_001_a9s=Wait, really?
M5180_S0010_G0050_001_op210=The world contains a vast amount of data. Coordinates. Network node readings. Photographic images. And so on.
M5180_S0010_G0060_001_op210=Analyzing this data can often lead to discovering new information.
M5180_S0010_G0070_001_op210=I spend my downtime seeking out such information.
M5180_S0010_G0080_001_a9s=That seems kind of boring. I mean, no offense.
M5180_S0010_G0090_001_op210=It is more interesting than engaging in mindless banter.
M5180_S0010_G0100_001_a9s=Hey!
M5180_S0010_G0110_001_op210=Still, there might be a way to make this chatter less mindless.
M5180_S0010_G0120_001_op210=There is a data terminal in the abandoned factory that I cannot access with our satellites.
M5180_S0010_G0130_001_op210=If you feel like helping, you can head over there and transfer the data to me.
M5180_S0010_G0140_001_sele=Happily agree to help.
M5180_S0010_G0150_001_sele=Grumble about what a pain that would be.
M5180_S0010_G0160_001_op210=Wonderful. I'll send the coordinates at once.
M5180_S0010_G0165_001_op210=The terminal is kind of hard to find, so keep your eyes peeled.
M5180_S0010_G0170_001_a9s=I'll let you know once I find it.
M5180_S0010_G0180_001_op210=I'll send the coordinates at once.
M5180_S0010_G0190_001_a9s=What? Hey! I didn't agree to help!
M5180_S0010_G0200_001_op210=You also didn't refuse.
M5180_S0010_G0210_001_a9s=Oh, come on!
M5180_S0010_G0211_001_op210=The terminal is kind of hard to find, but I know you can do it.
M5180_S0010_G0220_001_op210=Please examine the abandoned factory at your earliest convenience.
M5180_S0020_G0000_001_a9s=This whole place is like a giant machine's nest.
M5180_S0020_G0010_001_a9s=I wonder what it used to be like?
M5180_S0020_G0020_001_pod153=Accessing historical records...
M5180_S0020_G0030_001_pod153=Analysis: This location was once used for weapons production and experimentation.
M5180_S0020_G0040_001_a9s=No kidding? What kind of weapons?
M5180_S0020_G0050_001_pod153=Humanoid combat robots. Common examples include the P-22 and P-33 models.
M5180_S0020_G0060_001_a9s=Human-shaped weapons, huh? Wonder if they worked like flight units.
M5180_S0020_G0070_001_pod153=Unknown. No image-based information exists.
M5180_S0030_G0000_001_a9s=I think I can access the data over there...
M5180_S0030_G0010_001_a9s=There we go. That's what 21O wanted.
M5180_S0030_G0020_001_a9s=Now I just have to send it to her.
M5180_S0030_G0030_001_pod153=Alert: Poor reception in this area is preventing data upload.
M5180_S0030_G0040_001_pod153=Proposal: Unit 9S should move to an area with better reception.
M5180_S0030_G0050_001_a9s=Got it.
M5180_S0030_G0060_001_a9s=This should be good enough...
M5180_S0030_G0070_001_a9s=Pod, upload that data to Operator 21O.
M5180_S0030_G0080_001_pod153=Affirmative.
M5180_S0030_G0090_001_op210=Operator 21O to 9S, come in.
M5180_S0030_G0100_001_a9s=This is 9S.
M5180_S0030_G0110_001_op210=I received the data you sent.
M5180_S0030_G0120_001_op210=It's...fascinating.
M5180_S0030_G0130_001_op210=It appears to be the journal of a human who once worked in the factory.
M5180_S0030_G0140_001_a9s=What, like a diary?
M5180_S0030_G0150_001_op210=Yes. According to this, the man worked long hours on an almost daily basis.
M5180_S0030_G0160_001_op210=He says, and I quote, "They are working me like a machine."
M5180_S0030_G0170_001_op210=Working like a machine to build a machine? Humans truly were strange creatures.
M5180_S0030_G0180_001_a9s=Sounds like it.
M5180_S0030_G0190_001_op210=I'll send your reward later.
M5180_S0030_G0200_001_a9s=Wait, I can get rewarded for doing this?
M5180_S0030_G0210_001_op210=I didn't say you would not get a reward.
M5180_S0030_G0220_001_a9s=Noooooo, but...
M5180_S0030_G0230_001_a9s=H-Hey! Don't disconnect me!
M5920_S0020_G0180_001_pod153=Report: Mail notification received from access point.
