M5920_S0030_G0000_001_a2=Huh? What's that?
M5920_S0080_G0000_001_eml=I look forward to serving you again!
M5920_S0080_G0010_001_eml=...What was that? You want to know where I live?
M5920_S0080_G0020_001_a2b=I didn't ask that.
M5920_S0080_G0030_001_a9s=Uh, I don't think I asked about that.
M5920_S0080_G0040_001_a9s=I didn't ask that.
M5920_S0080_G0050_001_a2=No.
M5920_S0080_G0060_001_eml=Well, I live deep, deep underground. Picture something deep, then go DEEPER!
M5920_S0080_G0070_001_eml=Feel free to visit me anytime you want!
M5920_S0080_G0120_001_eml=Boy, the world's really going to hell in a handbasket, isn't it?
M5920_S0080_G0130_001_eml=I actually had a bandit break into my place a little while ago!
M5920_S0080_G0140_001_eml=After that, I put all my valuables in a secure container. Now I don't have to worry anymore!
M6020_S0000_G0000_300_eml=Owowowow...
M6020_S0000_G0010_300_eml=Oh! Heya!
M6020_S0000_G0020_300_eml=Can I help you with anything?
M6020_S0000_G0030_300_eml=Come again!
M6020_S0000_G0040_001_eml=Hope to see you again!
M6020_S0000_G0050_001_eml=Welcome!
M6020_S0000_G0060_001_eml=Hello!
M6020_S0000_G0070_001_eml=Er, welcome?
M6020_S0000_G0080_001_eml=Thank you!
M6020_S0000_G0090_001_eml=Thank you?
M6020_S0000_G0100_001_eml=Sorry about that. I didn't see you there.
M6020_S0000_G0110_001_eml=Sorry? Do you need something?
M6020_S0000_G0120_001_eml=You don't have to whack someone in the face to get their attention, you know?
M6020_S0000_G0130_300_eml=Ow! Owowowowowwww...
M6020_S0000_G0140_300_eml=Hey! I remember you from the other day!
M6020_S0000_G0150_300_eml=Sorry I got startled and ran away. ...Er, or rolled away, I guess.
M6020_S0000_G0160_300_eml=Anyway, my name's Emil, and this is my shop.
M6020_S0000_G0170_300_eml=Wanna buy something? I've got the best prices anywhere!
M6020_S0000_G0180_300_eml=Urgh...  Ow ow ow.
M6020_S0000_G0190_300_eml=You could've just asked me to stop, you know?
M6020_S0000_G0200_300_eml=Hey... You're A2, aren't you?
M6020_S0000_G0210_300_eml=It must be fate that we ran into each other. ...And since you're here, you might as well buy something!
M6020_S0000_G0230_300_eml=Oh! Welcome!
M6020_S0000_G0240_300_eml=...Hmm? Why am I running a shop like this?
M6020_S0000_G0250_300_eml=Yeaaaah, that's a really long story that we probably don't have time for.
M6020_S0000_G0260_300_eml=So how about you buy something instead?
M6020_S0000_G0270_300_eml=Thanks much!
M6020_S0000_G0280_300_eml=And what name should I put on the receipt?
M6020_S0000_G0290_300_eml=That's not necessary.
M6020_S0000_G0300_300_eml=...YoRHa brain scan complete. "2B," is it?
M6020_S0000_G0310_300_eml=Hope to see you again soon!
M6020_S0000_G0320_300_eml=......
M6020_S0000_G0330_300_eml=Um, I don't really think I need a receipt.
M6020_S0000_G0340_300_eml=...YoRHa brain scan complete. "9S," is it?
M6020_S0000_G0360_300_eml=Oooo-kay?
M6020_S0000_G0370_300_eml=Welcome!
M6020_S0000_G0380_300_eml=I think you're...A2, right?
M6020_S0000_G0390_300_eml=How did you know that?
M6020_S0000_G0400_300_eml=Oh, I just remembered something 2B said. Do you know 2B?
M6020_S0000_G0410_300_eml=She...
M6020_S0000_G0420_300_eml=She's beautiful! And kind! And unusually calm, all things considered.
M6020_S0000_G0430_300_eml=......
M6020_S0000_G0440_300_eml=What's wrong?
M6020_S0000_G0450_300_eml=Nothing. I'm sure she's doing well...wherever she is.
M6020_S0000_G0460_300_eml=I think so too. I hope you'll visit me again, A2!
