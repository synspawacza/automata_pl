M6010_S0090_G0020_300_op60=I don't know how you managed to beat Eve, but you did!  Now go take a nap or something. You totally earned it!

M6010_S0100_G0040_300_op210=9S has gone ahead and started the mission. Everything is proceeding well at the moment.
M6010_S0100_G0050_300_op210=Join up with him on-site and lend support however you can.
