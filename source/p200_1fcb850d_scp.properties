M1080_S0070_G0180_101_rbot9s=Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! 2B!
M1080_S0070_G0190_101_rbot9s=It's me! 9S!
M1080_S0070_G0200_101_a2b=...9S!?
M1080_S0070_G0210_101_a9s=I hacked into this machine from the Bunker. I'm controlling it!
M1080_S0070_G0220_101_a9s=I'm gonna break into this factory's systems and get you outta here!
M1080_S0070_G0230_101_a2b=Appreciated.
M1080_S0075_G0000_101_pod153=Pod 153: Hacking into factory system.
M1080_S0080_G0110_300_a9s=Uh oh... I'd better get to 2B fast!
M1080_S0080_G0120_300_a9s=Damn it! Maybe I should've taken over something with a little more power...
M1080_S0080_G0150_300_a9s=Look at all these broken machines...
M1080_S0080_G0160_300_a9s=A few still look usable. Better send these coordinates to the Bunker, just in case.
M1080_S0080_G0300_300_a9s=All right. If I can hack this elevator and get it running, I can get 2B and everyone else out of here!
