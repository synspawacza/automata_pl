M5122_S0010_G0000_300_ane=Sorry, but could you focus on your mission for now?
M5122_S0010_G0010_300_ane=I know you came here and everything, but...
M5123_S0010_G0000_001_ane=Seriously, you YoRHa types are something else.
M5123_S0010_G0010_001_a9s=Well, not to brag, but we ARE state-of-the-art units. Not like the A2 or those other old mode\u2014
M5123_S0010_G0020_001_ane=A2?
M5123_S0010_G0030_001_ane=Attacker Number 2?
M5123_S0010_G0040_001_a2b=You know her?
M5123_S0010_G0050_001_ane=No, not...
M5123_S0010_G0060_001_ane=......
M5123_S0010_G0070_001_ane=I'm sorry. Can I ask one more favor of you?
M5123_S0010_G0080_001_ane=Can you give me any information you have on that old A2 YoRHa unit? Anything at all.
M5123_S0010_G0090_001_a9s=That's funny\u2014we've been trying to find more information ourselves. Why are you asking?
M5123_S0010_G0100_001_ane=I just...need to be sure about something.
M5123_S0010_G0110_001_a2b=She wants intel on A2, does she? Where should we start?
M5123_S0010_G0120_001_a9s=We could check out the energy reactions generated during battles.
M5123_S0010_G0130_001_a9s=The fusion reactors of androids and machine lifeforms shut down when they're destroyed.
M5123_S0010_G0140_001_a9s=And we can detect the energy released during that process.
M5123_S0010_G0150_001_a9s=We're the only units doing any combat missions in this area, right?
M5123_S0010_G0160_001_a9s=So if we detect any stray energy reactions, it probably means A2 is involved.
M5123_S0010_G0170_001_a9s=...Yeah, okay. We've got some readings around the abandoned factory. I'll put it on the map.
M5123_S0010_G0180_001_a2b=Look.
M5123_S0010_G0190_001_a9s=That's A2's handiwork, I bet.
M5123_S0010_G0200_001_a9s=But I'm not picking up any sign of A2 herself.
M5123_S0010_G0210_001_a9s=Hmm? What in the world...?
M5123_S0010_G0220_001_a2b=Pod, help me out here.
M5123_S0010_G0230_001_pod042=Analysis: It is believed to be a data log related to YoRHa unit A2.
M5123_S0010_G0240_001_a2b=What's the data?
M5123_S0010_G0250_001_pod042=The data log has been irreparably damaged. Further analysis is impossible.
M5123_S0010_G0260_001_a2b=Why do a bunch of machines have A2's data?
M5123_S0010_G0270_001_a9s=Hey, 2B? I'm picking up other reactions. We should check them out.
M5123_S0010_G0280_001_ane=Is that...A2's data?
M5123_S0010_G0290_001_a2b=Some of it. But it's badly damaged, so we didn't learn much.
M5123_S0010_G0300_001_ane=It's still something. Thank you.
M5123_S0010_G0310_001_ane=You know, there might be more data chips in that same area.
M5123_S0010_G0320_001_ane=Please let me know if you find any.
M5123_S0010_G0330_001_a9s=Okay, I think that's the last of the data chips.
M5123_S0010_G0340_001_a2b=Pod, analyze and collate the information from those chips.
M5123_S0010_G0350_001_pod042=Analysis complete: Data set contains information about YoRHa unit A2.
M5123_S0010_G0360_001_pod042=Collating with data from other chips. Stand by...
M5123_S0010_G0370_001_pod042=Collation complete. The contained data is a debriefing report for the Pearl Harbor descent undertaken during the 14th Machine War.
M5123_S0010_G0380_001_a2b=No kidding.
M5123_S0010_G0390_001_a9s=That operation was carried out by the YoRHa generation that came before us, right?
M5123_S0010_G0400_001_a9s=Anyway, mission complete, I suppose. Let's get back to the Resistance camp.
M5123_S0030_G0000_001_a9s=We found more data from A2. Take a look.
M5123_S0030_G0010_001_ane=That's... It's Number 2.
M5123_S0030_G0020_001_ane=It really is her.
M5123_S0030_G0030_001_a2b=You know her?
M5123_S0030_G0040_001_ane=YoRHa unit Number 2. She's an older model, but the same type as you.
M5123_S0030_G0050_001_ane=We...worked together.
M5123_S0030_G0060_001_a9s=The Pearl Harbor drop?
M5123_S0030_G0070_001_ane=Yes.
M5123_S0030_G0080_001_ane=The operation itself was a success, but the YoRHa fighters were completely wiped out.
M5123_S0030_G0090_001_ane=Their commander was Number 2... A2.
M5123_S0030_G0100_001_ane=Have you met her? Do you know where she is?
M5123_S0030_G0110_001_a9s=Actually, we have orders from the Bunker to...destroy her.
M5123_S0030_G0120_001_ane=What!?
M5123_S0030_G0130_001_a9s=She's a deserter. She also wiped out an entire team that was sent to bring her back.
M5123_S0030_G0140_001_ane=A2...? No...
M5123_S0030_G0150_001_ane=I'm sorry, I...
M5123_S0030_G0160_001_a9s=......
M5123_S0030_G0170_001_a2b=Let's go, 9S.
M5123_S0030_G0180_001_a9s=Wonder what that was all about? Something must've been up between Anemone and A2...
M5123_S0030_G0190_001_a2b=Some things just aren't easy to talk about.
M5123_S0030_G0200_001_a2b=Especially for a soldier who's been fighting that long.
M5123_S0030_G0210_001_a9s=I guess so.
M5123_S0030_G0220_001_a2b=9S, you...
M5123_S0030_G0230_001_a9s=Huh?
M5123_S0030_G0240_001_a2b=...You might understand yourself someday.
M5123_S0030_G0250_001_a9s=Right...
