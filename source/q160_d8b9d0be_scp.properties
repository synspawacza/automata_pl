M5160_S0000_G0000_300_cmd=Take the necessary materials to the Resistance leader.
M5160_S0010_G0000_001_cmd=Actually, there's something I needed to ask you.
M5160_S0010_G0010_001_cmd=We need your help improving the network environment between the Bunker and the surface.
M5160_S0010_G0020_001_cmd=Doing so will allow us to carry out our operations in a more efficient manner.
M5160_S0010_G0030_001_cmd=First, I need you to transport the required materials to the leader of the Resistance camp.
M5160_S0010_G0040_001_cmd=I'll have an operator explain how to obtain the materials once you touch down.
M5160_S0010_G0050_001_a9s=Yes, Commander.
M5160_S0020_G0000_001_op60=Operator to 2B. Come in, 2B.
M5160_S0020_G0010_001_op60=We need you to collect the materials required to improve the network environment.
M5160_S0020_G0020_001_op60=You're going to need a rusty bolt, a small gear, and a broken key.
M5160_S0020_G0021_001_op60=You should be able to find them on small-sized enemies.
M5160_S0020_G0030_001_op60=Once you have everything, please take it to the Resistance leader, Anemone.
M5160_S0020_G0040_001_a2b=Understood.
M5160_S0020_G0050_001_op60=I know it's a bit of a pain, but good luck!
M5160_S0020_G0060_001_op210=Operator to 9S.
M5160_S0020_G0070_001_op60=I will now relay the materials necessary to improve the network environment.
M5160_S0020_G0080_001_op60=You need to acquire a rusty bolt, a small gear, and a broken key.
M5160_S0020_G0081_001_op60=You should be able to find them on small-sized enemies.
M5160_S0020_G0090_001_op60=Once you have the materials, bring them to Anemone, the leader of the Resistance.
M5160_S0020_G0100_001_a9s=Gotcha.
M5160_S0020_G0110_001_op210="Gotcha" is not an approved form of radio engagement, 9S. Operator 21O out.
M5160_S0030_G0000_001_op60=Operator 6O to 2B.
M5160_S0030_G0010_001_op60=Looks like you found all the necessary parts to improve our network environment. Nice work!
M5160_S0030_G0020_001_op60=You can conclude your mission by bringing everything over to Anemone.
M5160_S0030_G0030_001_op210=Operator 21O to 9S.
M5160_S0030_G0040_001_op60=I've confirmed that you have the necessary parts to improve our network environment.
M5160_S0030_G0050_001_op60=Take the materials to Anemone in the Resistance camp. Operator 21O out.
M5160_S0040_G0000_001_ane=I heard about this from the Bunker.
M5160_S0040_G0010_001_ane=These are the parts we need for our network structure, right? Thanks for bringing them over.
M5160_S0040_G0020_001_ane=It's not much, but I have a reward for you. Oh, but don't tell the Commander\u2014it's probably against regulations.
M5160_S0040_G0030_001_a2b=2B to Operator 6O. Material handover complete.
M5160_S0040_G0040_001_op60=Copy that. Good work!
M5160_S0040_G0050_001_a9s=I see the Commander's as much of a slave driver as ever.
M5160_S0040_G0060_001_a9s=It's like she was built to be as efficient and hard-assed as possible.
M5160_S0040_G0070_001_op60=Aw, she's not so bad.
M5160_S0040_G0080_001_a9s=Are you serious?
M5160_S0040_G0090_001_op60=Totally serious! The Commander actually lets a lot of things slide on the side.
M5160_S0040_G0100_001_op60=Like, did you know that she leaves piles of clothes strewn everywhere? The cleaning team is SO sick of it.
M5160_S0040_G0110_001_op60=Oh, and she never performs regular maintenance on herself.
M5160_S0040_G0120_001_op60=A lot of the "hard-ass" nature you mention is just for show.
M5160_S0040_G0130_001_a2b=How do you know all this?
M5160_S0040_G0140_001_op60=Hee hee! I can't tell you that...
M5160_S0040_G0150_001_op60=Operator 6O out.
M5160_S0040_G0160_001_a9s=What the heck was all that about?
M5920_S0010_G0280_001_pod042=Target location data obtained. Marking on map.
M5920_S0020_G0280_001_pod153=Target location data obtained. Marking on map.
M6090_S0010_G0000_300_ane=How's it going? You hanging in there?
