M1070_S0020_G0000_101_a2b=2B to Bunker, come in. Over.
M1070_S0020_G0000_300_dbl=......
M1070_S0020_G0010_101_op60=Operator to...2B!? 2B, are you all right!?
M1070_S0020_G0010_300_ppl=......
M1070_S0020_G0020_101_a2b=Running system diagnostics... Core functionality appears intact.
M1070_S0020_G0020_300_dbl=Once you approach a target, the scanner can make it visible.
M1070_S0020_G0030_101_op60=Thank goodness!
M1070_S0020_G0030_300_resiman=Sorry, this terminal is out-of-order right now.
M1070_S0020_G0040_101_a2b=Never mind that\u2014I need a status report.
M1070_S0020_G0050_101_op60=Roger that.
M1070_S0020_G0060_101_op60=In regards to the giant machine that attacked the shore,
M1070_S0020_G0070_101_op60=it ceased its resistance eight hours ago following your missile strike.
M1070_S0020_G0080_101_a2b=Eight...hours?
M1070_S0020_G0090_101_op60=However, its EMP strikes knocked out comms all across the region.
M1070_S0020_G0100_101_op60=We're having trouble getting them back online.
M1070_S0020_G0110_101_op60=Which means data uploading is currently unavailable in some areas.
M1070_S0020_G0120_101_a2b=Where's 9S?
M1070_S0020_G0130_101_op60=Um...yeah. About that.
M1070_S0020_G0140_101_op60=We picked up a faint black box reading, but it wasn't strong enough to lock down his position.
M1070_S0020_G0150_101_a2b=If you found something, that means he must be alive.
M1070_S0020_G0160_101_a2b=Put in a request to the Commander for immediate approval to begin a search.
M1070_S0020_G0170_101_op60=Actually, the Commander has already ordered us to prioritize tracking down surviving YoRHa members.
M1070_S0020_G0180_101_op60=If you find 9S...let me know. Okay?
M1070_S0020_G0190_101_a2b=Will do. 2B out.
M1070_S0020_G0200_101_a2b=Pod, I need you to scan for any nearby black-box signals.
M1070_S0020_G0210_101_pod042=......
M1070_S0020_G0220_101_pod042=Scanning complete. No signals detected.
M1070_S0020_G0230_101_pod042=However, a dynamic scanner is required for detection of weaker signals.
M1070_S0020_G0240_101_a2b=Never heard of it.
M1070_S0020_G0250_101_pod042=Said dynamic scanner may be located in the Resistance camp.
M1070_S0020_G0260_101_pod042=Proposal: Further information should be obtained from the Resistance leader.
M1070_S0020_G0270_101_a2b=Let's go.
M1070_S0020_G0280_101_ane=Hm? What's up?
M1070_S0020_G0290_101_a2b=I'm looking for something called a dynamic scanner that can detect black-box signals.
M1070_S0020_G0300_101_ane=A dynamic...? Oh, you must mean the one the twins built.
M1070_S0020_G0310_101_ane=I think they're just back from an expedition, actually.
M1070_S0020_G0321_101_ane=You should see some red-haired androids over there. Try talking to them.
M1070_S0020_G0330_101_ane=2B.
M1070_S0020_G0340_101_ane=Those twins, they...
M1070_S0020_G0350_101_a2b=Yes?
M1070_S0020_G0360_101_ane=Actually, never mind.
M1070_S0020_G0370_101_dbl=What do you want?
M1070_S0020_G0380_101_ppl=Easy, Devola. There's no need to be so confrontational.
M1070_S0020_G0390_101_dbl=And you don't have to trust every idiot that wanders by!
M1070_S0020_G0400_101_ppl=...I'm sorry about that. Can we help you?
M1070_S0020_G0410_101_sele=I need a scanner.
M1070_S0020_G0420_101_sele=No, not really.
M1070_S0020_G0421_101_a2b=I need a scanner that can detect faint black box signals.
M1070_S0020_G0422_101_a2b=No, not really.
M1070_S0020_G0430_101_dbl=Ah. Yeah, I was tinkering with something like that a little while back.
M1070_S0020_G0440_101_dbl=Here. If you want it, it's all yours.
M1070_S0020_G0460_101_ppl=That chip should help with your search, once you install it.
M1070_S0020_G0470_101_ppl=It can detect black-box signals, quest objects...all manner of things.
M1070_S0020_G0480_101_ppl=You'll hear a sound whenever it finds something.
M1070_S0020_G0490_101_dbl=And if it ever bugs you too much, you can always pop it back out.
M1070_S0020_G0500_101_ppl=Let us know if there's anything else you need from us, okay?
M1070_S0020_G0510_101_dbl=And don't think this makes us friends.
M1070_S0020_G0520_101_ppl=Oh, Devola...
M1070_S0040_G0000_101_a2b=I've picked up a response on the scanner.
M1070_S0040_G0010_101_a2b=Huh. This might be useful...
M1070_S0040_G0020_101_pod042=Search target 9S was caught in a large explosion over the water.
M1070_S0040_G0030_101_pod042=Proposal: The search for 9S should commence in the flooded region.
M1070_S0040_G0040_101_a2b=Got it.
M1070_S0040_G0050_101_a2b=It's funny...
M1070_S0040_G0060_101_a2b=You're oddly chatty today.
M1070_S0040_G0070_101_pod042=Affirmative. As a support unit, I am capable of engaging in conversation as necessary.
M1070_S0040_G0080_101_pod042=Proposal: 2B should initiate conversation more frequently.
M1070_S0040_G0090_101_a2b=...Proposal denied.
M1070_S0040_G0100_101_pod042=Black box signal detected. Life functions operational.
M1070_S0040_G0110_101_a2b=Pod, employ a check module and a logic-virus vaccine.
M1070_S0040_G0120_101_ys=Nnngh...
M1070_S0040_G0130_101_a2b=Easy. I've contacted the Bunker. They should be here soon.
M1070_S0040_G0140_101_ys=Th-thank you...
M1070_S0040_G0150_101_pod042=We are currently searching for a missing YoRHa unit, designation 9S.
M1070_S0040_G0151_101_pod042=We are currently searching for a missing YoRHa unit, designation 9S.
M1070_S0040_G0152_101_pod042=We are currently searching for a missing YoRHa unit, designation 9S.
M1070_S0040_G0160_101_pod042=Should you possess any information on the subject, please disclose it at once.
M1070_S0040_G0161_101_pod042=Should you possess any information on the subject, please disclose it at once.
M1070_S0040_G0162_101_pod042=Should you possess any information on the subject, please disclose it at once.
M1070_S0040_G0170_101_a2b=Please. Anything will help.
M1070_S0040_G0180_101_ys=9S... That's that kid who was with you, right?
M1070_S0040_G0190_101_ys=I saw him, all right. That explosion sent him flying...
M1070_S0040_G0200_101_pod042=Which direction?
M1070_S0040_G0210_101_ys=Hard to say... I'll take my best guess at a landing spot and transfer the data to you.
M1070_S0040_G0220_101_a2b=Thank you. You should stay here until the rescue team arrives.
M1070_S0040_G0230_101_a2b=9S should have landed around here...
M1070_S0040_G0240_101_pod042=Alert: Faint black box signal detected.
M1070_S0040_G0250_101_pod042=The transmission seems to be coming from an underground cave network.
M1070_S0040_G0251_101_pod042=Alert: You are moving away from the last known position of unit 9S.
M1070_S0040_G0252_101_a2b=Wrong route. Better go back and see if there's another one.
M1070_S0040_G0260_101_a2b=Would 9S have made it this far inside?
M1070_S0040_G0270_101_pod042=Alert: Possible enemy ambush ahead.
M1070_S0040_G0280_101_a2b=Don't care.
M1070_S0040_G0290_101_a2b=Why are there dead androids here?
M1070_S0040_G0300_101_pod042=No black box signals detected.
M1070_S0040_G0330_101_=W-where am I?
M1070_S0040_G0340_101_a2b=Don't worry. I sent out a rescue signal to the Bunker.
M1070_S0040_G0350_101_ys=Sorry... I have no clue...
M1070_S0040_G0360_101_a2b=That's okay. Just stay here and wait for backup to arrive.
M1070_S0040_G0370_101_ys=Ungh...
M1070_S0040_G0380_101_ys=W-what happened?
M1070_S0040_G0390_101_a2b=You got hit by an EMP blast.
M1070_S0040_G0400_101_ys=I...I don't remember anything...
M1070_S0040_G0410_101_a2b=Don't worry. I sent out a rescue signal to the Bunker.
M1070_S0040_G0420_101_ys=I'm sorry... I... I don't know anything.
M1070_S0040_G0430_101_a2b=That's okay. Just stay here and rest.
M1070_S0040_G0440_101_ys=W-who am I...?
M1070_S0040_G0450_101_ys=Ungh... Angh...
M1070_S0040_G0460_101_pod042=No anomalies detected in black box signal. However, her language core seems to have been damaged.
M1070_S0040_G0470_101_a2b=Poor thing... You're going to be fine, don't worry.
M1070_S0040_G0480_101_ys=Ah...
M1070_S0040_G0490_101_a2b=Pod, send a rescue signal to the Bunker.
M1070_S0040_G0500_101_pod042=Affirmative.
M1070_S0040_G0510_101_ys=Eh... Oh...
M1070_S0040_G0520_101_ys=...
M1070_S0040_G0530_101_a2b=No response.
M1070_S0040_G0540_101_pod042=Limited functionality detected in black box.
M1070_S0040_G0550_101_a2b=So she's still alive. Contact the Bunker.
M1070_S0040_G0560_101_pod042=Affirmative.
M1070_S0040_G0570_101_ys=...
M1070_S0040_G0580_101_ys=Eek! Who are you!?
M1070_S0040_G0590_101_a2b=Don't worry, I'm\u2014
M1070_S0040_G0600_101_ys=N-no... Get away from me! I don't like the look of you!
M1070_S0040_G0610_101_pod042=Proposal: remove fear functionality.
M1070_S0040_G0620_101_ys=No! Stay away! I hate you! I...hate...
M1070_S0040_G0630_101_a2b=Sorry to startle you. Just stay here and wait for help.
M1070_S0040_G0640_101_ys=Urrrgh....
M1070_S0040_G0650_101_ys=So...scared...
M5920_S0010_G0281_001_pod042=Target location data obtained. Marking on map.
M5920_S0120_G0000_001_op60=Bunker to 2B.
M5920_S0120_G0010_001_a2b=2B here.
M5920_S0120_G0020_001_op60=We've got a number of broken-down access points on the field.
M5920_S0120_G0030_001_op60=The cause appears to be an EMP attack from a gigantic machine lifeform.
M5920_S0120_G0040_001_op60=If you encounter any offline access points, please repair them for us.
M5920_S0120_G0050_001_a2b=Understood.
M5920_S0120_G0060_001_pod042=Access point repairs complete.
