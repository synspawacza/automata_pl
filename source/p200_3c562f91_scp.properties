M1050_S0150_S0000_001_kdc=Aim for the enemy androids!
M1050_S0150_S0010_001_kdc=Engage battle mode!
M1050_S0150_S0020_001_kdc=Now fight for your king!
M1050_S0150_S0030_001_all=For the king!
M1050_S0180_G0000_001_a9s=Here they come...
M1050_S0180_G0010_001_a9s=Better keep your guard up!
M1050_S0180_G0020_001_a2b=I'm aware of how to fight.
M1050_S0180_G0030_001_a2b=You just be careful.
M1050_S0180_G0040_001_a9s=I will, 2B!
M1050_S0180_G0041_001_a2b=These machines...
M1050_S0180_G0042_001_a9s=They were talking about a king, right?
M1050_S0180_G0043_001_a9s=I saw what looked to be a castle further in. Maybe we should take a look.
M1050_S0190_G0000_001_a9s=So those machines had a king?
M1050_S0190_G0010_001_a9s=But how can a concept like loyalty be understood by a machine?
M1050_S0190_G0011_001_a9s=How are we supposed to reach that castle?
M1050_S0190_G0050_001_n02=We must protect our king and kingdom!
M1050_S0190_G0060_001_n02=We will protect them!
M1050_S0190_G0070_001_n02=We must show our foes what we royal knights are made of!
M1050_S0190_G0080_001_n02=We will show them!
M1050_S0190_G0090_001_n02=We must fulfill our obligation to the king!
M1050_S0190_G0100_001_n02=We will fulfill!
M1050_S0190_G0110_001_n02=Er...but what is an "obligation"?
M1050_S0190_G0120_001_n02=But what is it!?
M1050_S0190_G0121_001_a9s=Looks like the freakshow's in town...
M1050_S0190_G0130_001_n02=No falling back! Fight!
M1050_S0190_G0140_001_n02=You have lived your whole life for this singular moment!
M1050_S0190_G0150_001_n02=For the Forest King!
M1050_S0190_G0160_001_n02=The Forest King!
M1050_S0190_G0170_001_a2b=What is with these guys...
M1050_S0190_G0180_001_a9s=Don't listen to what they're saying, 2B.
