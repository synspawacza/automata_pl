M4100_S0010_G0000_300_unknown=The YoRHa force was annihilated...\nAnd Earth went on to become a paradise for the machines.
M4100_S0020_G0000_300_unknown=YoRHa could not stand up to the might of the Goliaths; now their extinction is only a matter of time. It seems that mankind will never regain its former glory.
M4100_S0030_G0000_300_unknown=9S was last heard to say: "I can't control my curiosity about machines anymore. I'm leaving so I can study them as much as I want!" ...He was never heard from again.
M4100_S0040_G0000_300_unknown=2B and 9S chose to abandon their mission, allowing the machines to wreak destruction upon the city ruins and Resistance camp.
M4100_S0040_G0010_300_unknown=The extinction of YoRHa is also surely a matter of time.
M4100_S0050_G0000_300_unknown=9S waited several decades for 2B to return.\n...But she was never seen again.
M4100_S0060_G0000_300_unknown=In a sudden fit of temper, 2B wiped out the machine lifeforms, and no peace was born that day.
M4100_S0070_G0000_300_unknown=Having consumed the mackerel, it didn't take long for the android's bodily fluids to congeal. Muscle rigidity and paralysis soon followed.
M4100_S0070_G0010_300_unknown="It was good, though," the android thought as consciousness faded. "Exquisite even. No wonder humans used to eat them..."
M4100_S0080_G0000_300_unknown=Fed up, 2B left the camp to its fate and decided to...go fishing? Yeah, that's it! Fishing! With a smile on her face, she packed up and headed for the coast.
M4100_S0080_G0010_300_unknown=Ten years later, 2B would find herself hunted by both machine lifeforms and YoRHa assassins\u2014a life she seemed to enjoy more than her previous one.
M4100_S0090_G0000_300_unknown=A2 suddenly felt like taking a little stroll. Though the walk gave her a sense of peace and fulfilment, Pascal's village had been reduced to rubble when she returned.
M4100_S0100_G0000_300_unknown=A village of peaceful machines was wiped out through the actions of one deranged android.
M4100_S0100_G0010_300_unknown=Thus did the peaceful machines go extinct. Their village is now a haunted, forbidden place. Those who wander too close can hear the mad sounds of an android's laughter.
M4100_S0110_G0000_300_unknown=Some YoRHa units abandoned their mission, the operation failed, and every android met their demise.
M4100_S0110_G0010_300_unknown=...Well, except for the really selfish ones. They were fine.
M4100_S0120_G0000_300_unknown=The virus reached 2B's central nervous system. She soon lost all sense of reason, and ended up roaming the ruins until her power failed.
M4100_S0130_G0000_300_unknown=9S suddenly lost interest in 2B. No one knows why\u2014he just didn't care anymore.
M4100_S0140_G0000_300_unknown=A2 had a "bright" idea that involved destroying every machine in sight. Pascal could only watch in astonishment.
M4100_S0150_G0000_300_unknown=Of course, Devola and Popola died. Their lifeless bodies were found shortly thereafter, each clutched tightly in the other's arms.
M4100_S0160_G0000_300_unknown=Caution: Handle With Care!\nRemoval of the OS chip will result in death.
M4100_S0170_G0000_300_unknown=By self-destructing at the Bunker, the entire structure ended up exploding in a spectacular fashion. But hey, it sure did look pretty from Earth!
M4100_S0170_G0010_300_unknown=Somewhere in the depths of space, the Commander still floats about with a stern look on her face.
M4100_S0180_G0000_300_unknown=9S decided not to hack the Tower in order to help Devola and Popola. It was a nice thought, but they all ended up getting killed anyway.
M4100_S0200_G0000_300_unknown=A2 suddenly felt like taking a little stroll. And though the walk gave her a sense of peace and fulfilment, 2B's body had been consumed by machines when she returned.
M4100_S0210_G0000_300_unknown=The Emils caused their fusion reactors to go out of control, turning the planet into a dead chunk of rock, tumbling through the vast vacuum of an uncaring universe.
M4100_S0220_G0000_300_unknown=A2 destroyed Pascal. Pascal's death lead to the collapse of his village and its residents going out of control, resulting in the elimination of all androids on Earth.
