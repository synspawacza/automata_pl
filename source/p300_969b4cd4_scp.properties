M3010_S0020_G0050_001_pod042=Rather, it was the final order from this Pod's previous support assignment, unit 2B.
M3010_S0020_G0060_001_a2=Well, it's unnecessary.
M3010_S0020_G0070_001_pod042=YoRHa unit A2 lacks the authority to override this order.
M3010_S0020_G0080_001_a2=Whatever.

M3010_S0020_G0140_001_a2=What did I just say?
M3010_S0020_G0150_001_pod042=If an attending support unit is not provided with data related to the activity of its target,
M3010_S0020_G0160_001_pod042=it is programmed to automatically repeat the request every 30 seconds until such data is made available.
M3010_S0020_G0170_001_a2=Are you kidding me?
M3010_S0020_G0180_001_pod042=Proposal: Unit A2 should state her intentions.
M3010_S0020_G0190_001_pod042=Needlessly repeating conversations on the same topic is a waste of energy resources.

M3010_S0020_G0290_001_a2=Don't tell me what to do.
M3010_S0020_G0300_001_pod042=Pods are not authorized to issue commands.
M3010_S0020_G0310_001_pod042=Proposals are merely recommendations based on data provided by unit A2.
M3010_S0020_G0320_001_pod042=Proposal: Unit A2 should state updated intentions in order to secure more usable data.
