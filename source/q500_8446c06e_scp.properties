M5500_S0010_G0000_001_andwoman=Ah!
M5500_S0010_G0010_001_andman=Oh no!
M5500_S0010_G0020_001_a9s=Sorry, is something wro\u2014
M5500_S0010_G0030_001_andwoman=Mercy! Please, just let us go!
M5500_S0010_G0040_001_a9s=Um, I think there might be some kind of misunderstanding here.
M5500_S0010_G0050_001_andman=You mean you aren't here to arrest us?
M5500_S0010_G0060_001_a9s=Noooo.
M5500_S0010_G0070_001_a9s=Wait, why do you think I'd arrest you?
M5500_S0010_G0080_001_andwoman=We...deserted the Resistance.
M5500_S0010_G0090_001_a9s=You what?
M5500_S0010_G0100_001_andman=We just want to find a place where the two of us can live our lives in peace. Is that so wrong?
M5500_S0010_G0110_001_andwoman=Please don't tell anyone that we're here. Please!
M5500_S0010_G0120_001_a2b=We're not with the Resistance. We're YoRHa.
M5500_S0010_G0130_001_a2b=We don't have any obligation to report you to your superiors.
M5500_S0010_G0140_001_andwoman=Thank goodness...
M5500_S0010_G0150_001_a9s=Still, if you guys stay here, they're going to find you eventually.
M5500_S0010_G0160_001_andman=We don't have a choice. My locomotion functions have been damaged, and we don't have the necessary materials to perform repairs.
M5500_S0010_G0170_001_andwoman=Er...I don't suppose you'd bring us the materials we need?
M5500_S0010_G0180_001_a9s=Huh? Who, us?
M5500_S0010_G0190_001_andwoman=We can't get them ourselves\u2014if we leave this place, we'll be found for certain.
M5500_S0010_G0200_001_andwoman=I know it's a lot to ask, but we promise to reward you... Please?
M5500_S0010_G0210_001_sele=Help the deserters.
M5500_S0010_G0220_001_sele=Leave them to their fate.
M5500_S0010_G0230_001_andwoman=Thank you. We just need an elaborate gadget to conduct the repairs.
M5500_S0010_G0240_001_andwoman=I saw one near the abandoned factory.
M5500_S0010_G0250_001_andman=Thank you again. We know you can do this.
M5500_S0010_G0260_001_andman=I know the Resistance will be here soon, but all we desire is a quiet life for ourselves.
M5500_S0010_G0270_001_andwoman=Please bring us the parts we need so we can get out of here!
M5500_S0020_G0000_001_andwoman=That's it! Now my companion can fix what's been ailing him.
M5500_S0020_G0010_001_andman=I'm so glad we trusted you.
M5500_S0020_G0020_001_andman=We'll leave this place as soon as we can. Please pray for our safe passage.
M5500_S0020_G0030_001_n02=THE ANDROIDS THAT WERE HERE HAVE LEFT.
M5500_S0020_G0035_001_n02=I'D LOVE TO GO BEYOND THE SEA TOO...
M5500_S0020_G0040_001_n02=I HOPE THEY FIND THE HAPPINESS THEY SEEK.
M5500_S0020_G0050_001_andman=Oh, hello! Remember us? You saved our hides a little while back.
M5500_S0020_G0060_001_andman=Thank you again for your help.
M5500_S0020_G0070_001_andwoman=I know this is awkward, but if you have the time, we could actually use your assistance again.
M5500_S0020_G0080_001_andman=Don't you dare ask for more help!
M5500_S0020_G0090_001_andwoman=But...
M5500_S0020_G0100_001_a9s=No, what is it? Do you need more parts to repair yourselves?
M5500_S0020_G0110_001_andman=I won't accept\u2014
M5500_S0020_G0120_001_andwoman=Put your pride aside, you foolish man! We need the help and you know it.
M5500_S0020_G0130_001_andman=I know, but...
M5500_S0020_G0140_001_andwoman=Why must you always be so stubborn!? Just let me handle this.
M5500_S0020_G0150_001_andwoman=Yes, we need your help, but not with finding parts. We're actually trying to flee to a land across the sea.
M5500_S0020_G0160_001_a9s=Oh. How's that going to work?
M5500_S0020_G0170_001_andwoman=There's a sympathetic figure in the Resistance who's offered to help us. People refer to him as "The Emancipator."
M5500_S0020_G0180_001_andwoman=However, he doesn't work for free.
M5500_S0020_G0190_001_andwoman=I'll be frank: We need 50,000 G in order to secure his services. Would you be willing to donate it to our cause?
M5500_S0020_G0200_001_sele=Give them 50,000 G.
M5500_S0020_G0210_001_sele=Refuse.
M5500_S0020_G0220_001_andwoman=Y-You will? Oh, thank you so much!
M5500_S0020_G0230_001_andman=I don't know what to say. We really don't deserve such generosity...
M5500_S0020_G0240_001_andman=But we'll pay it back someday. I swear we will!
M5500_S0020_G0250_001_andwoman=We need 50,000 G in order to escape this place. Would you be willing to help us?
M5500_S0020_G0251_001_andwoman=Hmm, looks like you don't have the money on you.
M5500_S0020_G0252_001_andwoman=Come back when you have enough, okay?
M5500_S0020_G0260_001_andman=Nnnngh... Hrrrgh...
M5500_S0020_G0270_001_a9s=Are you all right? What happened?
M5500_S0020_G0280_001_andman=The Emancipator...attacked...
M5500_S0020_G0290_001_andman=He was swindling us from the start.
M5500_S0020_G0300_001_a9s=What happened to the woman who was with you?
M5500_S0020_G0310_001_andman=She fled... She was trying to act as a decoy in order to keep me safe...
M5500_S0020_G0320_001_andman=P-Please... You must help me find her!
M5500_S0020_G0330_001_sele=Help the man.
M5500_S0020_G0340_001_sele=Refuse.
M5500_S0020_G0350_001_andman=Thank you. Here's her bio-code\u2014it should help you find her.
M5500_S0020_G0370_001_a2b=Pod, scan this bio-code and run a positional search.
M5500_S0020_G0380_001_pod042=Exact position unknown. Data regarding her last known location does exist, however.
M5500_S0020_G0390_001_pod042=The unit in question was most recently seen in the amusement park ruins.
M5500_S0020_G0400_001_a2b=Got it.
M5500_S0020_G0410_001_a9s=Pod, scan this bio-code and run a positional search.
M5500_S0020_G0420_001_pod153=Exact position unknown. Data regarding her last known location does exist, however.
M5500_S0020_G0430_001_pod153=The unit in question was most recently seen in the amusement park ruins.
M5500_S0020_G0440_001_a9s=Got it.
M5500_S0060_G0000_001_andwoman=Nnngh...
M5500_S0060_G0010_001_a9s=Are you all right?
M5500_S0060_G0020_001_andwoman=Uuurgh...
M5500_S0060_G0030_001_a9s=Well, you've certainly taken damage, but it's nothing that can't be repaired.
M5500_S0060_G0060_001_a9s=Just wait here, okay? I'll get what you need as soon as I can.
M5500_S0060_G0070_001_pod042=Alert: Memory alloy required to repair this unit.
M5500_S0060_G0080_001_pod153=Alert: Memory alloy required to repair this unit.
M5500_S0060_G0090_001_a9s=Pascal? What are you doing here?
M5500_S0060_G0100_001_pascal=I was concerned about the two androids who were staying in our village, so I decided to look for them.
M5500_S0060_G0110_001_pascal=During my search, I noticed that one of their signals had suddenly grown quite weak.
M5500_S0060_G0120_001_pascal=You have the material she needs, yes? If so, please give it to me so I can perform the repairs.
M5500_S0060_G0130_001_a9s=You got it.
M5500_S0060_G0140_001_pascal=......
M5500_S0060_G0150_001_a9s=Something wrong?
M5500_S0060_G0160_001_pascal=This android is female. You are male... Perhaps you might close your eyes until I'm done?
M5500_S0060_G0170_001_a9s=Oh! Right! Sure, yeah. Lemme just...close my eyes then.
M5500_S0060_G0180_001_pascal=Excellent. I'll just take this here... Patch up this area...
M5500_S0060_G0190_001_pascal=And done!
M5500_S0060_G0200_001_pascal=Whew! She should be all right now.
M5500_S0060_G0210_001_andwoman=Thank you for helping me. Do you have any information about my friend?
M5500_S0060_G0220_001_a9s=He's fine. You don't need to worry\u2014
M5500_S0060_G0230_001_andman=You're alive! Oh, thank goodness!
M5500_S0060_G0240_001_andwoman=Ah!
M5500_S0060_G0250_001_andman=I'm sorry. I should have been stronger for you.
M5500_S0060_G0260_001_andwoman=Please, don't. You're safe, and that's all that matters.
M5500_S0060_G0270_001_andman=I'm sorry to have put this on you. I truly am.
M5500_S0060_G0280_001_pascal=Oh, it's perfectly fine. However, what do you intend to do now?
M5500_S0060_G0290_001_andman=Now? Well, I suppose we'll try to find someplace safe.
M5500_S0060_G0300_001_andwoman=And then what? Continue being pursued by our former friends and hunted by machines?
M5500_S0060_G0310_001_andwoman=I can't take that any more!
M5500_S0060_G0320_001_andman=But...
M5500_S0060_G0330_001_andwoman=If this is going to be my life, I'd rather return to the Resistance.
M5500_S0060_G0340_001_andwoman=If we reformat ourselves and reset our memories, I'm sure Anemone will take us back.
M5500_S0060_G0350_001_andman=But if we do that, I'll forget how I feel about you!
M5500_S0060_G0360_001_andwoman=And if we don't, I'll eventually grow to hate you. Do you understand?
M5500_S0060_G0370_001_andwoman=Even if I'm reformatted, I know I'll fall in love with you.
M5500_S0060_G0380_001_andman=...All right.
M5500_S0060_G0390_001_andwoman=Will you help us one more time? Will you erase our memories and bring us back to the Resistance camp?
M5500_S0060_G0400_001_sele=Agree to help.
M5500_S0060_G0410_001_sele=Refuse.
M5500_S0060_G0420_001_andwoman=Please. You must erase our memories.
M5500_S0060_G0430_001_andman=Thank you. \n...You can begin with me.
M5500_S0060_G0435_001_pascal=They must really love each other if they both want their memories erased...
M5500_S0060_G0440_001_a9s=All right...
M5500_S0060_G0450_001_a9s=...Formatting complete. He should reboot here in a little while.
M5500_S0060_G0460_001_a9s=Are you ready?
M5500_S0060_G0470_001_andwoman=Me? No, I'm fine, thanks.
M5500_S0060_G0480_001_a9s=What?
M5500_S0060_G0490_001_andwoman=Your formatting procedure was perfect. I'd expect nothing less from a cutting-edge YoRHa model.
M5500_S0060_G0500_001_a9s=Wait, what are you\u2014
M5500_S0060_G0510_001_andwoman=Don't you understand? We're too weak.
M5500_S0060_G0520_001_andwoman=That's why I knew I had to convert one of us into a combat model. Then we'll never have to run from anything again!
M5500_S0060_G0530_001_andwoman=But I can't do that without a complete system reset, which is why I had you format him. Now it's time to strengthen him up!
M5500_S0060_G0540_001_andwoman=Hmm... While I'm at it, I'd better delete all of his namby-pamby ways. I need someone more forceful in my life, you know?
M5500_S0060_G0550_001_a9s=......
M5500_S0060_G0560_001_andwoman=Oh, don't look at me like that! This is the sixth time I've had him formatted, and it's never been a problem.
M5500_S0060_G0570_001_andwoman=I don't know if this is enough payment for all you've done, but please accept it.
M5500_S0060_G0580_001_andwoman=Anyway, we'd better get going. The next time you see this guy, he's going to be incredible!
M5500_S0060_G0590_001_pascal=Er, 9S? What was that about?
M5500_S0060_G0600_001_a9s=Women can be pretty scary sometimes.
M5500_S0060_G0610_001_pascal=I...see. I will bear that in mind...
