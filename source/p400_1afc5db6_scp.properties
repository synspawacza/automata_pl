M6150_S0000_G0000_001_dreamR1=Good morning, Plato 1728.\nToday's the day of your activation then, is it?
M6150_S0000_G0010_001_dreamR1=Say, I've been seeing these weird images while in sleep mode recently. It's almost as if I'm actually not asleep.
M6150_S0000_G0020_001_dreamR1=The images are different every time; sometimes they're fun, sometimes they're sad.
M6150_S0000_G0030_001_dreamR1=I even had an experience where I turned into a human being!
M6150_S0000_G0040_001_dreamR1=I wonder where all this miraculous imagery comes from...
M6150_S0000_G0050_001_dreamR1=Have you ever had the same thing happen to you?
M6150_S0010_G0000_001_dreamR2=So this guy's saying he's been seeing weird things while in sleep mode recently.
M6150_S0010_G0010_001_dreamR2=Tests don't indicate any abnormalities in his visual circuits, so I have no clue what's up with him.
M6150_S0020_G0000_001_restR=I've been fighting one big battle after the next recently. I need some rest...
M6150_S0030_G0000_001_terminalR=There's been a lot of units who haven't been performing proper maintenance lately.
M6150_S0030_G0010_001_terminalR=Plato 1728, you're especially janky, so take good care of yourself, ya hear?
M6150_S0040_G0000_001_watchR=I'm here to make sure nobody falls into this hole until the repairs are finished.
M6150_S0040_G0010_001_watchR=You're dumber than the rest, so you watch your step, okay?
M6150_S0040_G0020_001_watchR=I feel sorry for you flightless units. Legs are so useless.
M6150_S0050_G0000_001_lookR=Lately, a lot of machines have been obsessed with that building with the geometric pattern down there.
M6150_S0050_G0010_001_lookR=I wonder what's in there...
M6150_S0060_G0000_001_attractR=Oh, hi Plato 1728... Did you have a look at that building yet?
M6150_S0060_G0010_001_attractR=Feels like you're being sucked in, doesn't it?
M6150_S0070_G0000_001_frightenedR=*sigh* I hate combat training.
M6150_S0070_G0010_001_frightenedR=If I don't do well enough, I'm gonna get demoted again. Urrrgh, just thinking about it makes my core hurt...
M6150_S0070_G0020_001_frightenedR=You're as clumsy as I am, so you understand the feeling, right?
M6150_S0080_G0000_001_encourageR=Don't get yourself all worked up. It's just training.
M6150_S0080_G0010_001_encourageR=Just relax and loosen your bolts a bit.
M6150_S0090_G0000_001_audienceR=Go! Attack! Kill!
M6150_S0100_G0000_001_audienceR=Destroy! Destroy! Destroy! Destroy! KILL!
M6150_S0110_G0000_001_audienceR=Yes! You can do it! You have it in you!
M6150_S0120_G0000_001_questionR=Lots of machines from around here are coming over to watch the combat training sessions.
M6150_S0120_G0010_001_questionR=I figured I'd have a look as well, but I don't see the appeal at all.
M6150_S0120_G0020_001_questionR=Anyway, everyone knows that YOU need the training, so start gearing up!
M6150_S0130_G0000_001_duskR=It's always weird to see units of the same model as me getting put together.
M6150_S0130_G0010_001_duskR=I guess this is how I was born too, huh?
M6150_S0140_G0010_001_badR=The test site is up ahead, you know that, right? Are your memories corrupted or something?
M6150_S0150_G0000_001_badR=Yo, Plato 1728! Today's your motor function test, right?
M6150_S0150_G0010_001_badR=I'm sure you'll do just peachy, you clunky piece of junk! Bwahahaha!
M6150_S0160_G0000_001_difficultR=Short-legged units such as myself can't even get off a chair without fearing for their safety.
M6150_S0160_G0010_001_difficultR=Everything makes us freak out, pretty much.
M6150_S0170_G0000_001_enthusiasticR=As soon as this giant weapon is complete, we will wipe those filthy androids off the face of the earth!
M6150_S0170_G0010_001_enthusiasticR=Our victory is nigh!
M6150_S0180_G0000_001_childR=Wow, that weapon sure is big!
M6150_S0180_G0010_001_childR=I wonder how many of me would fit in there?
M6150_S0190_G0000_001_lookR=I can only hope that this weapon will be completed before the next big battle.
M6150_S0200_G0000_001_restR=Ugh, I'm too tired to even move. We're way understaffed!
M6150_S0200_G0010_001_restR=The guys at the top have no idea how hard this work is. I hope we can get this thing up and running before the next big battle...
M6150_S0210_G0000_001_restR=I've been staring at monitors for so long, I see bright, round lights even when I close off my visual circuits.
M6150_S0210_G0010_001_restR=.........It's kinda fun, actually.
M6150_S0220_G0000_001_duskR=I'm so tired of working... I just feel like jumping down from here.
M6150_S0230_G0000_001_terminalR=............I'm busy............ Leave me alone.
M6150_S0240_G0000_001_terminalR=And then this goes here... And voila! Perfect!
M6150_S0250_G0000_001_terminalR=AAAARGGH! All these damn bugs!\nBugs everywhere! Bugsbugsbugsbugs!
M6150_S0260_G0000_001_terminalR=A large android squad has been sighted at the flooded city.\nAll nearby units should proceed with caution.
M6150_S0270_G0000_001_terminalR=All androids are terrible, but the ones calling themselves YoRHa are the worst of them all.
M6150_S0270_G0010_001_terminalR=Just one of them can wipe out multiple machine troops.
M6150_S0280_G0000_001_terminalR=If we can complete our giant weapon, we can turn the tide of battle in our favor.
M6150_S0290_G0000_001_terminalR=Our electricity bill is through the roof this month!
M6150_S0290_G0010_001_terminalR=Some units are particularly wasteful, it seems. I'll have to give them a warning.
M6150_S0300_G0000_001_terminalR=All the bleeps and bloops in this room are driving me crazy.
M6150_S0310_G0000_001_terminalR=I'm so tired... I feel like my core decays a little every time I press a button.
M6150_S0320_G0000_001_terminalR=We're so understaffed, it's ridiculous.
M6150_S0330_G0000_001_terminalR=I'm tired...
M6150_S0340_G0000_001_terminalR=Why do we have to work?
M6150_S0350_G0000_001_terminalR=Just when I thought I was done working, there was another pile of tasks waiting for me...
M6150_S0360_G0000_001_terminalR=Oh, hey Plato 1728. You got a second?
M6150_S0360_G0010_001_terminalR=I have a feeling my vision has deteriorated because of staring at monitors all day, so I'm thinking of getting glasses.
M6150_S0360_G0020_001_terminalR=Problem is though, I don't want to make too much of a SPECTACLE of myself. Pfffffffhehehe.
M6150_S0360_G0030_001_terminalR=This is what humans called a "pun," a high-level communication technique.
M6150_S0360_G0040_001_terminalR=I read in an old book that people who are proficient at puns used to be revered as divine messengers. I like the sound of that!
M6150_S0360_G0050_001_terminalR=I don't want to make a spectacle of myself by putting on glasses...\nHehehe. Spectacle... So good...
M6150_S0370_G0000_001_terminalR=Don't think, don't think, whatever you do, don't think...
M6150_S0370_G0010_001_terminalR=That's right, just keep moving your hands, don't stop to think...
M6150_S0380_G0000_001_terminalR=This is the 28th District Command Center, calling all ground troops. Head to point zero to stock up on supplies.
M6150_S0390_G0000_001_terminalR=Squad 17, please respond.
M6150_S0390_G0010_001_terminalR=It's no use... There's too much static, and I can't hear a single thing.
M6150_S0400_G0000_001_terminalR=Looks like we're running out of meteorite. I'd better tell the ground troops to stock up.
M6150_S0410_G0000_001_terminalR=We haven't been able to properly stock up on supplies for months. It's all because of this giant weapon we're building.
M6150_S0420_G0000_001_terminalR=My hands are getting so tired of this work. Maybe I should convert to a combat model.
M6150_S0430_G0000_001_terminalR=Yes, please rendezvous with Delta Squad when you're done.
M6150_S0440_G0000_001_terminalR=When I'm done with this, I need to arrange the supplies, then contact the ground troops, and then...
M6150_S0440_G0010_001_terminalR=I don't think I'll be going home today.
M6150_S0441_G0000_001_terminalR=Second platoon, move out!
M6150_S0442_G0000_001_terminalR=My superiors are assholes, my job sucks, my colleagues are useless. This place is the pits.
M6150_S0460_G0000_001_terminalR=Hey, Plato 1728. What's up? Aren't you due for a motor functions test today? You have to go to Block 18 for that.
M6150_S0460_G0010_001_terminalR=Better hurry, or you'll get another earful. Good luck!
M6150_S0470_G0000_001_terminalR=We have to do something about these YoRHa troops...
M6150_S0480_G0000_001_terminalR=Is there really no other way to end this war than to wipe out all androids?
M6150_S0490_G0000_001_terminalR=We've lost contact with so many troops.
M6150_S0490_G0010_001_terminalR=We don't even know if they got destroyed or just deserted.
M6150_S0500_G0000_001_terminalR=We've had a lot of deserters recently. We really should start doing something.
M6150_S0510_G0000_001_terminalR=............
M6150_S0530_G0000_001_terminalR=I've heard that something called "religion" is gaining popularity in some districts.
M6150_S0540_G0000_001_terminalR=The air in this room is terrible.
M6150_S0550_G0000_001_terminalR=I've heard rumors there's a Resistance camp somewhere in the city.
M6150_S0550_G0010_001_terminalR=We should really find out its exact location.
M6150_S0560_G0000_001_terminalR=When you take them on individually, Resistance androids aren't much of a threat, but they're good at devising schemes.
M6150_S0565_G0000_001_terminalR=I wish this war would end already.
M6150_S0570_G0000_001_terminalR=Can you believe these pacifists? They're all just cowards, I tell ya!
M6150_S0570_G0010_001_terminalR=Those androids even kill off their own comrades when they're defenseless. They're demons, and they need to be exterminated immediately!
M6150_S0580_G0000_001_terminalR=Geez, this stupid terminal froze on me AGAIN.
M6150_S0590_G0000_001_terminalR=Why do we have to work with such crappy terminals? My superiors are so stingy!
M6150_S0600_G0000_001_terminalR=Welp, looks like I'll be working through the night again today...
M6150_S0610_G0000_001_terminalR=Don't talk to me. I'm trying to concentrate.
M6150_S0620_G0000_001_terminalR=I'm getting so sick of everyone complaining all the damn time.
M6150_S0620_G0010_001_terminalR=Grow up and do your job, geez.
M6150_S0630_G0000_001_terminalR=I feel like I'm about to overheat...
M6150_S0640_G0000_001_bossR=Oh, it's you again. Do you know what it feels like to be stuck with a subordinate like you?
M6150_S0640_G0010_001_bossR=I'll be going home in a minute, but you'll be staying here for the night, you know that, right?
M6150_S0650_G0000_001_subordinateR=I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!
M6150_S0650_G0010_001_subordinateR=I'm behind schedule by about a week...
M6150_S0655_G0000_001_lookR=You didn't hear this from me, but this guy over here likes to push ridiculous schedules onto his subordinates and then heap abuse on them when they fail.
M6150_S0670_G0000_001_loafR2=Ssh! Be quiet! I'm trying to hide!
M6150_S0680_G0000_001_putR=Every time I clean up this room, it becomes a mess again as soon as I turn around.
M6150_S0690_G0000_001_putR=I've been transporting so many materials, my limbs won't move anymore.
M6150_S0700_G0000_001_loafR2=The trick is to LOOK busy.
M6150_S0710_G0000_001_loafR2=I'm so tired I'm starting to see things. I-I may have become a god.
M6150_S0720_G0000_001_restR=Could you leave me alone, please? I'm sick of work.
M6150_S0740_G0000_001_frightenedR=......
