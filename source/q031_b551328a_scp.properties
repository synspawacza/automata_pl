M5031_S0020_G0000_001_a9s=Hang on, 2B.
M5031_S0020_G0000_300_a2b=We can't seem to locate the required material.
M5031_S0020_G0010_001_a2b=Hmm?
M5031_S0020_G0010_300_a9s=Maybe we should ask an Operator.
M5031_S0020_G0020_001_a9s=This machine is still alive.
M5031_S0020_G0020_300_a9s=9S to Operator. Quick question: Do you know where we might find a pristine screw?
M5031_S0020_G0030_001_a2b=So destroy it.
M5031_S0020_G0030_300_op210=According to our records, that material can be obtained from the bodies of large bipedal machine lifeforms.
M5031_S0020_G0040_001_a9s=Maybe we should hold off.
M5031_S0020_G0040_300_a9s=Thanks, Operator. 9S out.
M5031_S0020_G0050_001_a9s=Its main drive has been trashed, so there's no way it can attack us.
M5031_S0020_G0050_300_a2b=I remember seeing large two-legged machines in the desert...
M5031_S0020_G0060_001_a9s=And we might be able to learn something interesting if we study it.
M5031_S0020_G0060_300_a9s=Let's go.
M5031_S0020_G0070_001_a9s=I'm going to try and repair some of its damaged circuits.
M5031_S0020_G0070_300_a2b=Finding this stuff is proving tougher than I'd hoped.
M5031_S0020_G0080_001_a2b=Why?
M5031_S0020_G0090_001_a9s=So we can learn more about the machines! Don't you think it's at least worth a shot?
M5031_S0020_G0100_001_a2b=If you say so.
M5031_S0020_G0100_300_a2b=Now's not the time to be fixing this thing.
M5031_S0020_G0110_001_a9s=Hmm... I'm going to need a pristine screw in order to finish the repairs.
M5031_S0020_G0120_001_a2b=We might be able to find one in the remains of other enemies.
M5031_S0020_G0125_001_a9s=Pod, search for the locations of relevant enemies.
M5031_S0020_G0130_001_a2b=You know, I'm still not sure any of this is a good idea.
M5031_S0020_G0140_001_a9s=The more data we have, the better, right?
M5031_S0030_G0000_001_a9s=We can use this screw to repair that big machine.
M5031_S0030_G0005_001_telo=47 minutes later...
M5031_S0030_G0010_001_a9s=Okay then. Let's see what we've got...
M5031_S0030_G0020_001_eng=I a......cal......gles 110......
M5031_S0030_G0030_001_eng=I was manu......huma......
M5031_S0030_G0040_001_eng=Request......ation of......stat......
M5031_S0030_G0090_001_a2b=This thing can talk?
M5031_S0030_G0100_001_a9s=It seems to be replaying some kind of data.
M5031_S0030_G0110_001_a9s=Machines don't have a conscious mind, you know.
M5031_S0030_G0120_001_a2b=......
M5031_S0030_G0130_001_a9s=I managed to pull some data out of its memory.
M5031_S0030_G0140_001_a9s=It seems to be info on the factory where it was constructed.
M5031_S0030_G0150_001_a9s=I'll save it in a readable format.
M5031_S0030_G0160_001_a2b=Is this everything?
M5031_S0030_G0170_001_a9s=No, it seems there's more.
M5031_S0030_G0180_001_a9s=But I need additional parts to access the rest.
M5031_S0030_G0190_001_a9s=Let's see... Four pristine screws and one large gear should be enough to bridge the gap in its memory circuits.
M5031_S0030_G0200_001_a2b=Fair enough.
M5540_S0030_G0400_001_op210=Operator 21O here. Go ahead.
M5920_S0010_G0280_001_pod042=Target location data obtained. Marking on map.
M5920_S0020_G0280_001_pod153=Target location data obtained. Marking on map.
