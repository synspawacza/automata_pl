M5550_S0010_G0000_001_ys=You... You're an older YoRHa model.
M5550_S0010_G0010_001_ys=Not that it matters.
M5550_S0010_G0020_001_ys=You... You're a YoRHa unit! Then some of you survived?
M5550_S0010_G0030_001_a9s=Yeah. I'm 9S, by the way.
M5550_S0010_G0031_001_ys=Oh yeah, I've heard of you... You're the model people used to call "Nines", right?
M5550_S0010_G0032_001_a9s=Yeah.
M5550_S0010_G0040_001_ys=I'm 4S. It's impressive that you're still alive, 9S.
M5550_S0010_G0050_001_a9s=You're a Type-4 model, eh? You guys were deployed pretty early on if I remember correctly.
M5550_S0010_G0060_001_4s=I sure wasn't expecting to run into another Scanner model.
M5550_S0010_G0070_001_4s=Not after what happened to the Bunker...
M5550_S0010_G0080_001_a9s=So what are you doing here?
M5550_S0010_G0090_001_4s=Gathering intel on the enemy.
M5550_S0010_G0100_001_4s=YoRHa might be a thing of the past, but the Resistance is still around.
M5550_S0010_G0110_001_4s=So as long as my body works, I figure I should make myself useful.
M5550_S0010_G0120_001_4s=If you have any information about local enemies, can you share it with me? There's only so much I can do on my own.
M5550_S0010_G0130_001_a9s=Sure. I'll give you everything I have at the moment.
M5550_S0010_G0135_001_telo=You handed over the enemy data.
M5550_S0010_G0140_001_4s=Thank you.
M5550_S0010_G0150_001_4s=If you obtain further enemy data, please let me know. It's important for us to share what we have.
M5550_S0010_G0160_001_4s=If you run into any new enemies, I'd very much like to look over your data.
M5550_S0010_G0170_001_4s=New enemy data, is it? Thank you.
M5550_S0010_G0180_001_4s=Oh, and there's no need to come all the way here every time you find a new enemy. Just swing by when you've collected a decent amount of data.
M5550_S0020_G0030_001_4s=More enemy data, eh? I appreciate it.
M5550_S0020_G0040_001_4s=Hmm... Interesting...
M5550_S0020_G0050_001_4s=Comparing your data with mine reveals a number of individual differences between machines of late.
M5550_S0020_G0060_001_4s=It looks like different regions have their own specialized machines. Almost like the environment is affecting them somehow. But of course that's absurd...
M5550_S0020_G0070_001_4s=Oh, right. I should pay you for your trouble. Please take this.
M5550_S0020_G0080_001_4s=Hey, by the way, would you mind if I called you "Nines" too, just like everyone else?
M5550_S0020_G0090_001_a9s=Go ahead. Nobody calls me that anymore though.
M5550_S0020_G0100_001_4s=Sore subject, is it? Sorry.
M5550_S0030_G0020_001_4s=More enemy data, eh? I appreciate it.
M5550_S0030_G0030_001_4s=I try my best, but I just can't cover all this ground on my own.
M5550_S0030_G0040_001_4s=Thanks again, Nines. You're really helping out here.
M5550_S0030_G0045_001_4s=Here's something for your trouble.
M5550_S0030_G0050_001_4s=Let me know if you find any more data, all right?
M5550_S0040_G0020_001_4s=More enemy data, eh? I appreciate it.
M5550_S0040_G0030_001_4s=Hmm... I recognize a few of the enemies in this data. My team fought some of them a while back.
M5550_S0040_G0040_001_4s=I used to have a big team...until the virus corrupted them all.
M5550_S0040_G0050_001_4s=I was wounded in the battle before the virus attack, so I was in dormant mode when it was unleashed. That's how I survived.
M5550_S0040_G0060_001_4s=But now I'm all alone...
M5550_S0040_G0070_001_4s=Er, sorry. I'm rambling. Thanks again for the data, Nines.
M5550_S0040_G0080_001_4s=Let me know if you find anything else.
M5550_S0050_G0020_001_4s=More enemy data, eh? I appreciate it.
M5550_S0050_G0030_001_4s=It's great having another Scanner helping me out. Thanks to you, I've gathered the data 60 percent faster than I'd planned.
M5550_S0050_G0040_001_4s=...I wonder how long we'll be doing this.
M5550_S0050_G0050_001_4s=It's not like we YoRHa androids have a home to return to.
M5550_S0050_G0060_001_a9s=Yeah, but gathering intelligence is still important. It's a huge support for the war effort.
M5550_S0050_G0070_001_4s=I KNOW THAT!
M5550_S0050_G0080_001_4s=...Sorry, Nines. I didn't mean to yell at you.
M5550_S0050_G0090_001_4s=Anyway, this chunk of data you brought means I've finally hit my goal.
M5550_S0050_G0100_001_4s=I'd like you to have this. It belonged to an old friend, but I think he'd be happy to know that you're using it.
M5550_S0050_G0110_001_4s=See you around, Nines. And remember: No regrets, okay?
M5550_S0050_G0120_001_4s=We need to think about what we're going to do from this point forward.
M5550_S0050_G0130_001_4s=Thanks for everything.
