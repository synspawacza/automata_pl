M5540_S0030_G0320_001_a9s=Can you tell us about the YoRHa soldiers who were stealing your supplies?
M5540_S0030_G0330_001_ane=This is the first I've heard of it.
M5540_S0030_G0340_001_a9s=Huh?
M5540_S0030_G0350_001_ane=I mean, we keep our supplies in multiple locations, but so far as I know, nothing's gone missing.
M5540_S0030_G0360_001_a9s=I see. Well, thanks.
M5540_S0030_G0370_001_a9s=So it turns out those soldiers didn't actually steal anything. Which means...what?

M5540_S0030_G0430_001_a9s=No, but I mean... The Resistance says that none of their supplies are actually missing.
M5540_S0030_G0440_001_a9s=So what's going on here?
M5540_S0030_G0450_001_op210=...I lack access to the data concerning this mission.
M5540_S0030_G0460_001_a9s=Huh?
M5540_S0030_G0470_001_op210=The order came from the Commander herself.
M5540_S0030_G0480_001_a9s=What? Operator, I don't understand\u2014
M5540_S0030_G0490_001_op210=Be careful, 9S.
M5540_S0030_G0500_001_op210=I have no further information.
M5540_S0030_G0510_001_a9s=Huh? Operator? ...Operator?
M5540_S0030_G0520_001_a9s=The hell is that all about?
M5540_S0030_G0530_001_a2b=Let's go.
