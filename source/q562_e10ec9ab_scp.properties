M5561_S0010_G0000_001_ppl=Hello again.
M5562_S0010_G0000_001_dbl=Hey! You have a second? I've got a little favor to ask.
M5562_S0010_G0010_001_dbl=We need some tree sap to repair a tent, but there are some super strong enemies guarding it.
M5562_S0010_G0020_001_dbl=We can't even dent the things with the flimsy little weapons we have, so maybe you can\u2014
M5562_S0010_G0030_001_a9s=Hey, Devola? Why do you two keep getting all these incredibly dangerous odd jobs?
M5562_S0010_G0040_001_a9s=If fighting is involved, there are plenty of androids more suited for the task.
M5562_S0010_G0041_001_dbl=I...
M5562_S0010_G0042_001_dbl=...
M5562_S0010_G0043_001_dbl=I'm sorry...
M5562_S0010_G0050_001_a2=Shut up for a second. Why do you two keep getting assigned the most dangerous jobs?
M5562_S0010_G0060_001_a2=You're not exactly equipped to handle this kind of thing.
M5562_S0010_G0080_001_dbl=We really should be handling our own tasks.
M5562_S0010_G0090_001_ppl=Devola...
M5562_S0010_G0100_001_sele=Help the twins out.
M5562_S0010_G0110_001_sele=Do nothing.
M5562_S0010_G0120_001_a9s=No! It's not that! Honestly, I'm happy to help you guys if you need it.
M5562_S0010_G0130_001_a9s=I'm YoRHa, remember? I'm way more suited to this line of work than you are anyway.
M5562_S0010_G0140_001_a9s=What was it you needed again? Tree sap?
M5562_S0010_G0150_001_a2=Stop it. I'll take the job.
M5562_S0010_G0160_001_a2=I'm better at killing crap than you, anyway.
M5562_S0010_G0170_001_a2=What was it you needed again? Tree sap?
M5562_S0010_G0180_001_dbl=That's okay. We'll handle this one ourselves.
M5562_S0010_G0190_001_ppl=Devola, I think we should accept the assistance.
M5562_S0010_G0200_001_dbl=Come on, Sis! We can't keep\u2014
M5562_S0010_G0210_001_ppl=Thank you. You have no idea how much this helps.
M5562_S0010_G0220_001_dbl=Sorry we had to ask this of you...
M5562_S0020_G0000_001_a9s=Oh shoot! I forgot to ask Devola where to find that tree sap she wanted.
M5562_S0020_G0010_001_a9s=Pod, search for regions where I might be able to obtain tree sap.
M5562_S0020_G0020_001_pod153=Search already performed. Regions rich in tree sap marked on map.
M5562_S0020_G0030_001_a2=Aw, crap. I forgot to ask the redhead where to find tree sap.
M5562_S0020_G0040_001_a2=Where the heck am I gonna find that?
M5562_S0020_G0050_001_pod042=Search already performed. Regions rich in tree sap marked on map.
M5562_S0020_G0060_001_a2=Well, aren't YOU a helpful little box?
M5562_S0020_G0070_001_pod153=Alert: Hostile machine lifeforms detected.
M5562_S0020_G0080_001_a9s=The ones Devola mentioned, maybe?
M5562_S0020_G0081_001_a9s=What's with the crazy shape?
M5562_S0020_G0090_001_pod042=Alert: Hostile machine lifeforms detected.
M5562_S0020_G0100_001_a2=Well, let's get it over with.
M5562_S0020_G0101_001_a2=Huh. That's...something.
M5562_S0020_G0110_001_a9s=Now I just need to collect some tree sap.
M5562_S0020_G0120_001_a2=Now that the fun's over, it's time to collect some tree sap.
M5562_S0020_G0130_001_a9s=Hopefully this is enough sap.
M5562_S0020_G0140_001_a2=That oughta be enough sap. Time to head back.
M5562_S0030_G0000_001_ppl=Hello again. Did you manage to secure the tree sap?
M5562_S0030_G0010_001_ppl=Thank you. I know this must have been difficult.
M5562_S0030_G0020_001_a9s=Is Devola...sleeping?
M5562_S0030_G0030_001_a2=Is Devola...sleeping?
M5562_S0030_G0040_001_ppl=She was drinking. I think she finally passed out.
M5562_S0030_G0050_001_ppl=She's been trying to cut back, but with things as rough as they are... Well, everyone needs a release, I suppose.
M5562_S0030_G0060_001_a9s=As rough as they are?
M5562_S0030_G0070_001_a2=What do you mean, "rough"?
M5562_S0030_G0080_001_ppl=It's not easy being a defective model, you know?
M5562_S0030_G0090_001_ppl=In the past, a pair of models identical to ours caused a major incident.
M5562_S0030_G0100_001_dbl=Popola! POPOLAAAAA! My glassh ain't getting any fuller over here!
M5562_S0030_G0110_001_dbl=Buncha no good... Razza frazza...
M5562_S0030_G0120_001_ppl=Tee hee! Oh, Devola...
M5562_S0030_G0130_001_ppl=She does love that particular spirit. She makes it with desert rose, actually.
M5562_S0030_G0140_001_ppl=You're welcome to try some if you like.
M5562_S0030_G0150_001_dbl=Huh? Whuzza? NO! Keep yer goddamn handsh off my BOOZE!
M5562_S0030_G0160_001_dbl=It's MINE! Mine. I'm gonna...drink it all up!  Mee-YOW!
M5562_S0030_G0170_001_a9s=...Meow?
M5562_S0030_G0180_001_a2=...Meow?
M5562_S0030_G0190_001_ppl=Heh. She can say some pretty odd things in her sleep.
M5562_S0030_G0200_001_a9s=Aren't you going to drink anything?
M5562_S0030_G0210_001_a2=So you gonna have a belt or what?
M5562_S0030_G0220_001_ppl=Oh, maybe next time.
M5562_S0030_G0230_001_ppl=When I drink... Well, it's not always a good thing. Let's leave it at that.
M5562_S0030_G0240_001_ppl=Anyway, thank you again. You should take a bit of time to rest if you can.
M5562_S0030_G0261_001_dbl=Nooooo... Can't drink any more.... Zzzzz...
M5562_S0030_G0262_001_dbl=Think I'm gonna puke... Zzzzzz...
M5562_S0030_G0263_001_dbl=It'sh...not our fault... Zzzzzz...
M6090_S0020_G0780_300_dbl=Are you looking for something?
