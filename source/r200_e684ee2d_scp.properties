M5032_S0030_G0000_001_eng=I am tired. I must rest.
M5032_S0030_G0010_001_eng=Hello, androids.
M5032_S0030_G0020_001_eng=I have nothing to do. Tell me a story.
M5032_S0030_G0030_001_a2b=What?
M5032_S0030_G0040_001_a9s=Er, there isn't much we can tell you. Most of our data is classified.
M5032_S0030_G0050_001_eng=A story of the past would be fine.
M5032_S0030_G0060_001_eng=Tell me about how this city used to be.
M5032_S0030_G0070_001_a9s=Well, I suppose we can try.
M5032_S0030_G0080_001_a2b=This city was once home to a great number of humans.
M5032_S0030_G0090_001_eng=Numbers beyond counting?
M5032_S0030_G0100_001_a9s=Something like that. Don't you remember driving them out of here?
M5032_S0030_G0110_001_eng=Humans were already gone at the time of my manufacture.
M5032_S0030_G0120_001_eng=All I know is ruin. And androids.
M5032_S0030_G0130_001_a9s=Regardless, don't expect us to forgive you for the sins of your people.
M5032_S0030_G0140_001_eng=Machine lifeforms do not comprehend the concept of "sin."
M5032_S0030_G0150_001_a9s=Let's go, 2B.
M5032_S0030_G0160_001_a2b=Sounds good.
M5032_S0030_G0170_001_eng=Thank you for visiting me previously.
M5032_S0030_G0180_001_a2b=How are you?
M5032_S0030_G0190_001_eng=I am, as one says, "trucking along."
M5032_S0030_G0200_001_a2b=Does one actually say that?
M5032_S0030_G0210_001_eng=I have been reading through humanity's records to keep myself occupied.
M5032_S0030_G0220_001_eng=This has led me to a question.
M5032_S0030_G0230_001_a2b=Shoot.
M5032_S0030_G0240_001_eng=What is "night"?
M5032_S0030_G0250_001_a2b=Night?
M5032_S0030_G0260_001_a9s=You must mean the cyclical cycle of light and dark that used to exist. The records mentioned that, did they?
M5032_S0030_G0270_001_a9s=The sun never leaves the sky anymore, but apparently, it used to descend below the horizon for hours at a time.
M5032_S0030_G0280_001_a9s=When that happened, it was like looking out of one of the Bunker's windows.
M5032_S0030_G0290_001_a2b=I didn't know that.
M5032_S0030_G0300_001_eng=I would...like to see...stars sometime...
M5032_S0030_G0310_001_eng=......
M5032_S0030_G0320_001_a9s=What's going on? You seem pretty low, even by machine standards.
M5032_S0030_G0330_001_eng=My lifespan's expiration period is drawing to a close.
M5032_S0030_G0340_001_a9s=Are you asking us to repair you? Because that's a pretty selfish request.
M5032_S0030_G0350_001_eng=No. Do not repair me.
M5032_S0030_G0360_001_a9s=Huh?
M5032_S0030_G0370_001_eng=I have been thinking about something.
M5032_S0030_G0380_001_eng=Do you remember when you spoke of "sin"?
M5032_S0030_G0390_001_eng=You were right to call it so.
M5032_S0030_G0400_001_eng=I killed many of your kind. Killed androids beyond counting.
M5032_S0030_G0410_001_eng=It meant nothing while I was connected to the network.
M5032_S0030_G0420_001_eng=But now I understand.
M5032_S0030_G0430_001_eng=I know the anguish it has caused you.
M5032_S0030_G0440_001_eng=I must atone.
M5032_S0030_G0450_001_a9s=Wait. Are you...
M5032_S0030_G0460_001_eng=My existence is ending. I am...dying.
M5032_S0030_G0470_001_eng=Please take my parts...and use them elsewhere.
M5032_S0030_G0480_001_eng=Farewell...androids...
M5032_S0030_G0490_001_a9s=Ah!
M5032_S0030_G0500_001_a2b=......
M5032_S0030_G0510_001_a9s=Wow... It just chose death.
M5032_S0030_G0520_001_a2b=We're no different.
M5032_S0030_G0530_001_a9s=Huh? How so?
M5032_S0030_G0540_001_a2b=We've destroyed machines beyond counting.
M5032_S0030_G0550_001_a2b=Perhaps someone sees that as a sin.
M5032_S0030_G0560_001_a9s=2B...
M5032_S0030_G0570_001_a9s=No good. It's beyond repair. It must've finally reached the end of the line.
M5032_S0030_G0580_001_eng=Commencing self-defense protocols.
M5032_S0030_G0590_001_eng=Well done, YoRHa soldiers. I am...defeated...
