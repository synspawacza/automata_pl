M1080_S0030_G0000_101_ane=Damn... 9S really went through hell.
M1080_S0030_G0010_101_ane=But you're the boss. You want him sent up to Command body and all, I'll make it happen.
M1080_S0030_G0020_101_a2b=Thanks...
M1080_S0030_G0030_101_ane=Oh!
M1080_S0030_G0040_101_a2b=What?
M1080_S0030_G0050_101_ane=Nothing, just...you've never been much for gratitude, you know?
M1080_S0030_G0060_101_a2b=......
M1080_S0030_G0070_101_ane=Not that I mind or anything.
M1080_S0030_G0080_101_ane=Oh, um, I also have a message for you.
M1080_S0030_G0090_101_ane=Command needs you to contact them ASAP.
M1080_S0030_G0100_101_a2b=Got it.
M1080_S0030_G0110_101_a2b=This is 2B. Patch me through to the Commander.
M1080_S0030_G0120_101_op60=Oh, hey, 2B. Roger that.
M1080_S0030_G0130_101_op60=Gimme just a second here...
M1080_S0030_G0140_101_cmd=2B.
M1080_S0030_G0150_101_cmd=Good job destroying that machine.
M1080_S0030_G0160_101_cmd=Upon further analysis, we learned that the machine\u2014code named Adam\u2014was responsible for managing half of their entire network.
M1080_S0030_G0170_101_cmd=A disruption of this magnitude to their network should weaken the machines significantly.
M1080_S0030_G0180_101_a2b=What's going to happen to 9S?
M1080_S0030_G0190_101_cmd=He'll undergo a full data overhaul up here.
M1080_S0030_G0200_101_cmd=Assuming we don't encounter any problems, we're planning to partner him with you again.
M1080_S0030_G0210_101_a2b=Thank you.
M1080_S0030_G0220_101_cmd=In the meantime, I have another mission for you.
M1080_S0030_G0230_101_cmd=I've mailed you the briefing. Go ahead and take a look.
M1080_S0030_G0240_101_a2b=Understood.
M1080_S0030_G0250_101_a2b="Analyze current trends among the machines?" ...Huh.
M1080_S0030_G0260_101_a2b=Something tells me this is going to involve a lot of killing.
M1080_S0030_G0270_101_pod042=Proposal: Procure information from the machine lifeform known as Pascal.
M1080_S0030_G0280_101_a2b=Hmm. I suppose he might know something.
M1080_S0030_G0290_101_a2b=Pascal? Can you hear me?
M1080_S0030_G0300_101_pascal=Oh, hello, 2B. Do you need something?
M1080_S0030_G0310_101_a2b=I need to know if you've seen any new trends or behaviors among the machines.
M1080_S0030_G0320_101_pascal=New...trends? Hmm...
M1080_S0030_G0330_101_pascal=Well, two days ago I was contacted by some machines that disconnected themselves from the network.
M1080_S0030_G0340_101_pascal=They wanted to discuss a peace treaty.
M1080_S0030_G0350_101_a2b=No kidding.
M1080_S0030_G0360_101_pascal=Apparently, they're seeking to form an alliance of some kind with our village.
M1080_S0030_G0370_101_a2b=If that's what they want, why don't they move in?
M1080_S0030_G0380_101_pascal=I believe they're working on building a colony of their own.
M1080_S0030_G0390_101_a2b=You don't say.
M1080_S0030_G0400_101_pascal=Indeed. Apparently, it's located in the abandoned factory.
M1080_S0030_G0410_101_pascal=I can give you the coordinates if you'd like.
M1080_S0030_G0420_101_a2b=Please.
M1080_S0030_G0430_101_pascal=I was actually planning to go speak with them myself, you know.
M1080_S0030_G0440_101_pascal=Maybe we can meet up over there?
M1080_S0030_G0450_101_a2b=Sounds good.
M1080_S0030_G0460_101_pascal=Oh, 2B! Hello!
M1080_S0030_G0470_101_pascal=Are you ready to go?
M5920_S0010_G0180_001_pod042=Report: Mail notification received from access point.
M5920_S0010_G0281_001_pod042=Target location data obtained. Marking on map.
