M5130_S0010_G0000_001_resiwoman=Owwwwww...
M5130_S0010_G0010_001_a9s=Hey, you're with the Resistance, right? Are you okay?
M5130_S0010_G0020_001_resiwoman=Nnngh... You know that explosion that happened in the ruins?
M5130_S0010_G0030_001_resiwoman=The shockwave hit me like...well, a shockwave, I guess. Knocked my circuits all out of whack, but I managed to\u2014
M5130_S0010_G0040_001_resiwoman=Wait a second... You look familiar\u2014have we met before?
M5130_S0010_G0050_001_a2b=Me? No. But lots of YoRHa models look alike.
M5130_S0010_G0060_001_resiwoman=Oh... So, you two are with YoRHa, are you?
M5130_S0010_G0070_001_a9s=Um, yes? Why do you want to know?
M5130_S0010_G0080_001_resiwoman=No reason! I mean, I've just heard stories about how advanced you guys are, and how kind, and...
M5130_S0010_G0090_001_resiwoman=Okay, fine. I need help.
M5130_S0010_G0100_001_a9s=Well, sure, I guess? What's the problem?
M5130_S0010_G0110_001_resiwoman=What happened is, my friend who was with me on this mission was killed, and...
M5130_S0010_G0120_001_resiwoman=I want to retrieve her final moments.
M5130_S0010_G0130_001_resiwoman=This broken Pod was recording her life log. Think you can get it for me?
M5130_S0010_G0140_001_sele=Help her out.
M5130_S0010_G0150_001_sele=Refuse.
M5130_S0010_G0160_001_resiwoman=Thank you.
M5130_S0010_G0170_001_resiwoman=I need you to get my friend's life log out of this Pod...
M5130_S0010_G0180_001_a9s=All right. I just need to extract some images, right?
M5130_S0010_G0190_001_telo=You extracted the images from the life log.
M5130_S0030_G0000_001_a9s=...That was the last entry contained in the life log.
M5130_S0030_G0010_001_a9s=I could be wrong, but it looked like two Resistance members fighting each other.
M5130_S0030_G0020_001_resiwoman=So my friend was killed by the Resistance? By one of her own!?
M5130_S0030_G0030_001_a9s=Easy. We haven't finished fully restoring the data.
M5130_S0030_G0040_001_a9s=It won't be complete until we dig into a deeper layer and\u2014
M5130_S0030_G0050_001_resiwoman=No. That's enough. I don't need to know any more.
M5130_S0030_G0060_001_resiwoman=That person in the red hood killed my friend...
M5130_S0030_G0070_001_resiwoman=And she's going to pay for it!
M5130_S0030_G0080_001_a9s=Wait!
M5130_S0030_G0090_001_resiwoman=What is it?
M5130_S0030_G0100_001_a9s=Where are you going?
M5130_S0030_G0110_001_resiwoman=To kill the bastard who murdered my friend!
M5130_S0030_G0120_001_a9s=Just slow down, all right? We need more data about what happened.
M5130_S0030_G0130_001_a9s=Besides, it's dangerous. The killer could be watching you right now for all we know.
M5130_S0030_G0140_001_resiwoman=Fine then. What do YOU think I should do?
M5130_S0030_G0150_001_a9s=Let me ask around the Resistance camp before you go running off.
M5130_S0030_G0160_001_a9s=There can't be that many people in red hoods, after all. Someone must know something.
M5130_S0030_G0170_001_resiwoman=All right. I can wait for a little while.
M5130_S0030_G0180_001_resiwoman=Hey, and...thanks.
M5130_S0030_G0190_001_a2b=Well. Aren't we generous?
M5130_S0030_G0200_001_a9s=Hmm?
M5130_S0030_G0210_001_a2b=All this help for no personal gain? I know she's pretty, but\u2014
M5130_S0030_G0220_001_a9s=Whoa, whoa! It's not like that!
M5130_S0030_G0230_001_a9s=I mean, she IS pretty, but that's... It's not...
M5130_S0030_G0240_001_a2b=Whatever.
M5130_S0120_G0000_001_a9s=We need to find someone wearing a red hood.
M5130_S0120_G0010_001_a9s=Say, nice hood. You make it?
M5130_S0120_G0020_001_resiwoman2=What, this? No, a girlfriend of mine gave it to me.
M5130_S0120_G0030_001_resiwoman2=This is the first time I've worn it in public. Do you really like it?
M5130_S0120_G0040_001_a9s=Yeah, it's great. In fact, I wish I had one for myself.
M5130_S0120_G0050_001_a9s=Do you happen to know where she got it?
M5130_S0120_G0060_001_resiwoman2=No, sorry. I didn't think to ask.
M5130_S0120_G0070_001_a9s=Do you know where your friend is? Maybe I'll go ask her myself.
M5130_S0120_G0080_001_resiwoman2=Man, you REALLY like this hood!
M5130_S0120_G0090_001_resiwoman2=Last I heard, she was out at the desert station.
M5130_S0120_G0100_001_resiwoman2=She shouldn't be hard to find\u2014I think she's the only woman there.
M5130_S0120_G0110_001_a9s=Thanks. I appreciate it.
M5130_S0120_G0120_001_resiwoman2=Hope you manage to get a hood of your own!
M5130_S0130_G0000_001_a9s=Sounds like that red hood was a gift of some sort.
M5130_S0130_G0010_001_a2b=Gifts are such a useless ritual.
M5130_S0130_G0020_001_a9s=Wow, okay. Where'd THAT come from?
M5130_S0130_G0030_001_a2b=It's rude to give a person something without their permission.\nWhat if they don't want it?
M5130_S0130_G0040_001_a9s=Hmm. I think it's more about the feeling behind it than the actual item, right?
M5130_S0130_G0050_001_a2b=Feelings are prohibited.
M5130_S0130_G0060_001_a9s=Yeah, yeah.
M5130_S0130_G0070_001_a2b=One affirmation will suffice.
M5130_S0130_G0080_001_a9s=Oh, for the love of... Fine. "Yeah."
M5130_S0130_G0090_001_a9s=Our red-hooded target should be in the desert.
M5130_S0130_G0100_001_a2b=Stay alert. She could be our killer.
M5130_S0130_G0110_001_a9s=But there's only one female resistance member at the desert station...
M5130_S0130_G0120_001_a9s=Hmm. I don't see her.
M5130_S0130_G0130_001_a2b=Let's ask that guy over there.
M5130_S0130_G0140_001_resiman=...How's that? You're looking for a Resistance lady?
M5130_S0130_G0150_001_resiman=Oh, you must mean Jackass, huh?
M5130_S0130_G0180_001_resiman=Every time there's an issue, ol' Jackass tries to solve it with explosives or some other violent method.
M5130_S0130_G0190_001_resiman=I think she's off doing geological research in one of the desert caves.
M5130_S0130_G0200_001_resiman=I'll send you the coordinates if you want.
M5130_S0130_G0210_001_resiman=Oh, but if you're gonna head out there\u2014
M5130_S0130_G0220_001_resiman=Just make sure you don't get caught up in one of her explosions, you hear?
M5130_S0130_G0240_001_a9s=Excuse me? Are you...um..."Jackass"?
M5130_S0130_G0250_001_jackas=Who wants to know?
M5130_S0130_G0260_001_a9s=We're with YoRHa. We're conducting a field investigation.
M5130_S0130_G0270_001_resiwoman2=Well, yippee for you.
M5130_S0130_G0280_001_a9s=Listen, did you happen to give a red hood to a friend earlier?
M5130_S0130_G0290_001_a9s=That red is perfect for our new YoRHa colors, so we were hoping to\u2014
M5130_S0130_G0300_001_jackas=That old piece of crap? Yeah, I gave it to her. Hell, I never wanted it in the first place.
M5130_S0130_G0310_001_a9s=Er, so it came from someone else originally?
M5130_S0130_G0320_001_jackas=Did I stutter? Yeah, it came from someone else. I bought the stupid thing right after that explosion in the city ruins.
M5130_S0130_G0330_001_jackas=Some Resistance lady with red hair practically tackled me trying to get me to buy it.
M5130_S0130_G0340_001_jackas=I only did it to get her off my case. Well, and because I thought it might look good on my friend... But if you tell her that, you're dead!
M5130_S0130_G0350_001_a9s=A red-haired Resistance member...
M5130_S0130_G0360_001_pod153=The same color as our client's hair.
M5130_S0130_G0370_001_jackas=What client? What the hell's going on here?
M5130_S0130_G0380_001_a9s=Uh, nothing! It's just...that's her nickname. "The Client."
M5130_S0130_G0390_001_jackas=That's even stupider than Jackass!
M5130_S0130_G0400_001_jackas=That lady WAS pretty creepy, though.\nKept grinning at me like a crazy person.
M5130_S0130_G0410_001_a9s=Grinning...?
M5130_S0130_G0420_001_a9s=Uh, well, thanks for your help. We'll be on our way.
M5130_S0140_G0000_001_pod153=Alert: The description of a female Resistance member with red hair matches that of our client.
M5130_S0140_G0010_001_a9s=But if it's the same person, why would she have had the killer's hood?
M5130_S0140_G0020_001_pod153=Hypothesis: The red-haired Resistance member is either the killer or an accomplice.
M5130_S0140_G0030_001_a2b=Let's go talk to her.
M5130_S0140_G0040_001_resiwoman=So? How'd it go? Did you find that murdering wench in the red hood?
M5130_S0140_G0050_001_a9s=Not...exactly.
M5130_S0140_G0060_001_a9s=But we DID learn that you sold the hood to someone.
M5130_S0140_G0070_001_resiwoman=Wha!?
M5130_S0140_G0080_001_a9s=Apparently a red-haired Resistance member sold the hood after the explosion in the ruins.
M5130_S0140_G0090_001_resiwoman2=This doesn't make sense...
M5130_S0140_G0100_001_a9s=We're starting to believe you had something to do with the murder.
M5130_S0140_G0110_001_resiwoman2=But that's impossible! I don't know about any of that...
M5130_S0140_G0120_001_a9s=Listen, if you\u2014
M5130_S0140_G0130_001_resiwoman2=Look, you said there were still some records left in this Pod, right?
M5130_S0140_G0140_001_resiwoman2=Then we have to look at them right now!
M5130_S0140_G0150_001_a9s=Think about this for a second. I want you to understand what you're asking.
M5130_S0140_G0160_001_a9s=You may have killed your own friend. I don't know why or how, but it's possible.
M5130_S0140_G0170_001_resiwoman=I don't care. I have to know the truth. Please!
M5130_S0140_G0180_001_a9s=...All right. I'm heading in.
M5130_S0150_G0010_001_resiwoman=Ah! Ahhhhh...
M5130_S0150_G0020_001_resiwoman=I... I'm a Type-E... A YoRHa Type-E...
M5130_S0150_G0030_001_a9s=YoRHa?
M5130_S0150_G0040_001_resiwoman=My function is to seek out and execute deserters and traitors.
M5130_S0150_G0050_001_resiwoman=I disguise myself so I can approach my targets and kill without warning.
M5130_S0150_G0060_001_resiwoman=But one day, I was ordered to kill my friend.
M5130_S0150_G0070_001_resiwoman=So I did. I had my orders, and I followed them.
M5130_S0150_G0080_001_a2b=......
M5130_S0150_G0090_001_resiwoman=It was hard. So hard. And after a while, I couldn't live with what I had done.
M5130_S0150_G0100_001_a9s=So you erased your own memories.
M5130_S0150_G0110_001_resiwoman=Yes.
M5130_S0150_G0120_001_resiwoman=But...this wasn't the first time.
M5130_S0150_G0130_001_resiwoman=I've killed comrades. Friends. Lovers. I've done it more times than I can count. Again and again and again and...
M5130_S0150_G0140_001_resiwoman=Hee.
M5130_S0150_G0150_001_resiwoman=Eee hee hee hee hee.
M5130_S0150_G0160_001_a9s=Um, are you all right?
M5130_S0150_G0170_001_resiwoman=Yes. I am "all right." Everything is "all right."
M5130_S0150_G0180_001_resiwoman=I am a YoRHa Type-E. E for "Execution."
M5130_S0150_G0190_001_resiwoman=I follow orders. I kill my friends. Eee hee hee!
M5130_S0150_G0200_001_resiwoman=And you solved it! Solved the murder! Eee hee! Now I have to pay you! Eee hee hee!
M5130_S0150_G0210_001_a9s=Wait, you don't\u2014
M5130_S0150_G0220_001_resiwoman=Eee hee hee! Do you need a friend killed? A lover? It's my job! My job! Hee! My job! Hee hee! My j-job my j-j-job my-y-y-yyyyy jjjooooeeeheeheeeeeee...
M5130_S0150_G0230_001_a2b=...Let's go.
M5130_S0150_G0240_001_a9s=Type-E... I didn't know there was such a thing.
M5130_S0150_G0250_001_a9s=Did you, 2B?
M5130_S0150_G0260_001_a2b=......
M5130_S0150_G0270_001_a2b=Some things are better left unknown.
M5130_S0150_G0280_001_a9s=...Yeah. I suppose so.
