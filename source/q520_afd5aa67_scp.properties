M5520_S0010_G0000_001_pascal=Hello there! Er, so I was wondering if you might help me with a small project.
M5520_S0010_G0010_001_pascal=I'd like you to collect and bring back any information you find regarding the old world during your travels.
M5520_S0010_G0020_001_a9s=Really? Why?
M5520_S0010_G0030_001_pascal=I'm hoping to use whatever knowledge remains of the old world to make life better for those here in the village.
M5520_S0010_G0040_001_pascal=I'll be glad to share anything we find with you as well, of course. So would you be willing to assist us?
M5520_S0010_G0050_001_sele=Help him out.
M5520_S0010_G0060_001_sele=Don't bother.
M5520_S0010_G0070_001_pascal=Thank you. Please show me anything of interest you find.
M5520_S0010_G0075_300_pascal=Let me know if you find any data on the old world.
M5520_S0010_G0080_001_pascal=Oh? But surely knowledge of the old world would benefit you as well. Is there any chance you might reconsider?
M5520_S0010_G0090_001_pascal=Take pity on this poor old machine lifeform before you and lend us your aid!
M5520_S0010_G0100_001_pascal=Please, my friend. Look inside yourself...
M5520_S0010_G0110_001_pascal=Relics of the old world are certain to make life easier for our children. I do hope you will reconsider.
M5520_S0020_G0000_001_a9s=Hey, Pascal? Is this the kind of old-world information you were looking for?
M5520_S0020_G0010_001_pascal=Ah! Thank you so much. I find this data from mankind to be ever so fascinating...
M5520_S0020_G0020_001_pascal=I know it's not much, but please take this as thanks.
M5520_S0020_G0030_001_pascal=Superb! Thank you for this valuable information.
M5520_S0020_G0040_001_pascal=Please take this as a reward.
M5520_S0020_G0050_001_a9s=It's data from the old world, but it's...
M5520_S0020_G0060_001_pod153=This data is related to the creation of nuclear fission weapons.
M5520_S0020_G0070_001_a9s=Oh, geez. I wonder if we should really hand this over to Pascal...
M5520_S0020_G0080_001_a9s=I mean, the Commander might want it, right?
M5520_S0020_G0090_001_pod153=Only unit 9S is qualified to make that decision.
M5520_S0020_G0100_001_pascal=Ah. Let me see...
M5520_S0020_G0110_001_pascal=Oh my. This is valuable information indeed.
M5520_S0020_G0120_001_a9s=Yeah...
M5520_S0020_G0130_001_pascal=Nuclear fission technology is something that was lost to us long ago.
M5520_S0020_G0140_001_pascal=It presents many technical challenges, not to mention the devastating effects it has on the environment. This is why our creators had the data sealed away.
M5520_S0020_G0150_001_pascal=...I'm sorry 9S, but I cannot accept this information. It is simply too dangerous.
M5520_S0020_G0160_001_a9s=Oh?
M5520_S0020_G0170_001_pascal=However, I thank you for bringing it to my attention.
M5520_S0020_G0180_001_pascal=Allow me to repay you with this.
M5520_S0020_G0190_001_pascal=9S...
M5520_S0020_G0200_001_pascal=If I reject the knowledge of nuclear weapons and our village is destroyed at some point in the future, do you think my people would resent me for it?
M5520_S0020_G0210_001_a9s=I don't know, Pascal. That's not for me to decide.
M5520_S0020_G0220_001_pascal=I see.
M5520_S0020_G0230_001_cmd=Yes, 9S? What is it?
M5520_S0020_G0240_001_a9s=Commander, I've discovered data from the old world that includes information on nuclear fission.
M5520_S0020_G0250_001_a9s=I wasn't sure what to do with it, so...
M5520_S0020_G0260_001_cmd=Nuclear armaments, is it?
M5520_S0020_G0270_001_cmd=As you're likely aware, by order of the Council of Humanity, our use of nuclear weapons is restricted.
M5520_S0020_G0280_001_cmd=However, I've always been curious as to why the machines also seem to abide by the same restrictions.
M5520_S0020_G0290_001_cmd=That's a riddle I may never solve, but at any rate, it's probably prudent for us to preserve the data.
M5520_S0020_G0300_001_a9s=Understood.
M5520_S0020_G0310_001_cmd=Good work, 9S. And while I shouldn't reward you for doing your duty, I'll at least send some maintenance resources to your room. Feel free to make use of them.
M5520_S0020_G0320_001_a9s=Thank you, Commander.
