M5150_S0010_G0000_001_resiman=Leave me alone, Jackass! I can't deal with your weird hobbies anymore!
M5150_S0010_G0001_300_jackas=Feel like helping yet?
M5150_S0010_G0010_001_jackas=Like I care what you think, jerk!
M5150_S0010_G0011_300_sele=Agree to help Jackass.
M5150_S0010_G0020_001_jackas=Oh. Hey there.
M5150_S0010_G0021_300_sele=Carefully turn her down.
M5150_S0010_G0030_001_jackas=Listen, just ignore that guy. Selfish fool refuses to help me with my work.
M5150_S0010_G0050_001_jackas=See, I'm doing a study on the excitement levels of androids while in battle.
M5150_S0010_G0060_001_jackas=But I need to record combat data from the newest models in order to reach more steady conclusions. So whatcha think? Fun, right?
M5150_S0010_G0070_001_sele=Agree to help Jackass.
M5150_S0010_G0080_001_sele=Carefully turn her down.
M5150_S0010_G0090_001_resiman=Man, I have had it up to HERE with Jackass lately. I mean, come on...
M5150_S0020_G0000_001_jackas=All right! Good to know not everyone around this joint is a spineless hunk of crap!
M5150_S0020_G0001_001_jackas=Here. Follow me.
M5150_S0020_G0002_001_jackas=All right. See that jerk over there?
M5150_S0020_G0003_001_jackas=I need you to get combat data for him.
M5150_S0020_G0010_001_jackas=Science will pay you back for this, I promise. Now...FIGHT!
M5150_S0020_G0030_300_jackas=Come on! Do it already! Don't hold anything back!
M5150_S0020_G0040_300_jackas=Hey, what's the hold-up? Hurry up and start kicking some ass!
M5150_S0020_G0050_300_jackas=Feel like helping yet?
M5150_S0020_G0060_300_sele=Agree to help.
M5150_S0020_G0070_300_sele=Beg off.
M5150_S0020_G0080_300_jackas=Peachy. Let's get rolling, then.
M5150_S0020_G0090_300_jackas=Freakin' USELESS. If you change your mind, let me know, I guess.
M5150_S0020_G0100_300_jackas=I can't just whip up a complicated drug like this overnight. Go keep yourself busy for a while, yeah?
M5150_S0020_G0111_300_jackas=I need your help with my research, but I'm kinda tied up at the moment.
M5150_S0020_G0121_300_jackas=Come back later. And don't forget!
M5150_S0020_G0130_001_jackas=Oh man. Oh man, oh man. That was GREAT!
M5150_S0020_G0140_001_jackas=Hey, did you know that android battle fever is actually quite similar to the human emotion of "love"?
M5150_S0020_G0150_001_jackas=So if we want to know what all those old human records are always going on about, all we need to do is let our fists fly!
M5150_S0020_G0160_001_jackas=Makes this whole thing feel more romantic, don't you think?
M5150_S0020_G0170_001_jackas=Okay, that was pathetic. I mean, you are REALLY starting to chap my chrome over here. Now try it again!
M5150_S0020_G0180_001_jackas=I need you to wipe out those enemies over there. Think you can handle that? Mmmm?
M5150_S0020_G0308_001_jackas=There's lots of other research I need help with, so don't hesitate to holler at me.
M5150_S0020_G0309_001_jackas=There's plenty of stuff to do around here, so drop why when you feel bored.
M5150_S0020_G0310_001_jackas=Hey there! Big challenge this time, but I know you're up for it.
M5150_S0020_G0320_001_jackas=And I ALSO know you'll let me record some of that sweet, sweet data.
M5150_S0020_G0330_001_jackas=Okay! So I need you to wipe out those enemies over there without taking any damage. Like, at all. Zero. Zip. Naaaaada.
M5150_S0020_G0331_001_sele=Agree to help Jackass.
M5150_S0020_G0332_001_sele=Carefully turn her down.
M5150_S0020_G0340_001_jackas=Remember that science will reward you handsomely for your efforts. Now...FIGHT!
M5150_S0020_G0350_001_jackas=YESSSSS! I love you YoRHa goons. I really do. Just look at all this data!
M5150_S0020_G0360_001_jackas=Speaking of YoRHa goons, I'm a bit surprised you types are so...intellectual.
M5150_S0020_G0370_001_jackas=I thought combat models would be a bit more dense. Less thinking, more killing and all that?
M5150_S0020_G0380_001_jackas=Frankly, giving you any kind of intellect at all strikes me as pointless.
M5150_S0020_G0400_001_a2b=......
M5150_S0020_G0430_001_jackas=I need you to wipe out those enemies over there without taking any damage. Think you can handle that?
M5150_S0020_G0440_001_jackas=Okay, killers. I've prepared a real rogues' gallery of thugs for you today.
M5150_S0020_G0441_001_jackas=Still haven't had enough, eh? I like you! You've got GUTS! Metaphorically speaking, of course.
M5150_S0020_G0445_001_jackas=I want you to take out those enemies over there in 30 seconds or less.
M5150_S0020_G0450_001_jackas=Because more thugs means more data! And more data means we get some BEAUTIFUL SCIENCE up in this joint!
M5150_S0020_G0460_001_sele=Agree to get science up in the joint.
M5150_S0020_G0470_001_sele=Walk away.
M5150_S0020_G0480_001_jackas=You're doing good work here. You really are. Now...FIGHT!
M5150_S0020_G0490_001_jackas=Holy crispy crap on a stick... Now THIS is data!
M5150_S0020_G0500_001_jackas=Here, look at this. See this reaction? It proves that android brains contain an algorithm which allows them to derive pleasure from battle!
M5150_S0020_G0510_001_jackas=Without that, we'd probably have stopped fighting a long time ago. What a brutally efficient piece of evolution!
M5150_S0020_G0520_001_jackas=It's possible this is based on an identical pleasure center in the human brain. Man, those fleshbags really were something!
M5150_S0020_G0530_001_jackas=Are you serious about this or what? Come ON already!
M5150_S0020_G0535_001_jackas=I want you to wipe out those enemies in 30 seconds or less.
M5150_S0020_G0540_001_jackas=All right, my little science nerds. I have one more data-gathering battle for you.
M5150_S0020_G0545_001_jackas=I want you to wipe out those enemies in 30 seconds or less... Oh, and you can't take any damage either.
M5150_S0020_G0550_001_jackas=So let's get out there and do it already! Woo!
M5150_S0020_G0580_001_jackas=Excellent! The fruits of science are but a battle away! Now, FIGHT!
M5150_S0020_G0590_001_jackas=Bloody hell. Bloody, nasty, gut-strewn HELL! Do you know what I just discovered?
M5150_S0020_G0600_001_jackas=The excitement we feel in battle is caused by a type of pleasure-generating chemical produced in our circuits!
M5150_S0020_G0610_001_jackas=Anyway, I think I can localize this substance and turn it into a drug that will help expand our combat capabilities.
M5150_S0020_G0620_001_jackas=All these advances, and it's all thanks to YOU! ...See? I told you science was the best.
M5150_S0020_G0630_001_jackas=Anyway, keep an eye out for that drug. Once I get it synthesized, it's all yours.
M5150_S0020_G0640_001_jackas=Hey! This is NOT the time to start slacking off!
M5150_S0020_G0645_001_jackas=I want you to wipe out those enemies in 30 seconds or less without taking any damage. Now MAKE IT HAPPEN!
M5150_S0030_G0000_001_jackas=Ha! I bet SOMEONE'S here to try out my new combat wonder drug!
M5150_S0030_G0010_001_jackas=I've already handed it out to a few folks, and man, is it ever popular. One taste and you're hooked for life!
M5150_S0030_G0020_001_jackas=And yeah, it sounds bad when I say it like that, but your YoRHa buddies don't seem to mind.
M5150_S0030_G0030_001_jackas=Sure, there are some side effects... Like a horrifying destabilizing effect on one's psyche.
M5150_S0030_G0040_001_jackas=But none of that should be a problem for combat-focused models like you.
M5150_S0030_G0050_001_jackas=Anyway, the first round's on me. Check it out and let me know what you think.
M5150_S0030_G0071_001_jackas=If you want more, go visit the YoRHa unit at the oil field in the desert.
M5150_S0030_G0072_001_jackas=She was asking for the recipe, so I'm sure she's cooking up a stash of her own.
M5150_S0040_G0000_300_jackas=Hmmm, I still don't have enough data...\nI could use some more help.
M5150_S0040_G0010_300_jackas=More data... I NEED MORE DATA!\nAnd YOU are going to help me, right?\nThat's a rhetorical question by the way.
M5150_S0040_G0020_300_jackas=I just need a teensy bit more data...\nYou look like you've got nothing better to do, \nso give me a hand here!
M5150_S0040_G0030_300_sele=Give her a hand.
M5150_S0040_G0040_300_sele=Keep your hands to yourself.
M5150_S0040_G0050_300_jackas=That's what I'm talkin' about!
M5150_S0040_G0070_300_jackas=Excellent! You're the best guinea pig a gal could ask for! This should be the last bit of data I need.
M5150_S0040_G0075_300_jackas=Now it's time to fight! \nIn the name... OF SCIENCE!
M5150_S0040_G0100_300_jackas=You're the only one stu...uh, brave enough to do this for me. You know that, right?
M5920_S0010_G0180_001_pod042=Report: Mail notification received from access point.
