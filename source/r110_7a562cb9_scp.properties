M6090_S0091_G0000_300_hennawresi=Hey, you're with YoRHa, right?
M6090_S0091_G0010_300_hennawresi=Hmm? My mask?
M6090_S0091_G0020_300_hennawresi=It's an electromagnetic-wave shielding device. I wear it to limit unnecessary information from the world.
M6090_S0091_G0030_300_hennawresi=...Ha! Just kidding.
M6090_S0091_G0040_300_hennawresi=So what do you want? Are you worried about something or whatever?
M6090_S0091_G0050_300_hennawresi=It was fun talking with you. Come back anytime!
M6090_S0091_G0060_300_hennawresi=If you're worried about anything, you can always talk to me.
M6090_S0091_G0070_300_hennawresi=See you later then.
M6090_S0091_G0080_300_hennawresi=It must've been tough for you YoRHa.
M6090_S0091_G0090_300_hennawresi=Now we've got no Bunker, and we can't replenish our bodies. So if we die, there's no more recovery.
M6090_S0091_G0100_300_hennawresi=If you die now, it's the end, so I'd recommend saving as much as possible.
M6090_S0091_G0110_300_sele=How do I save?
M6090_S0091_G0120_300_sele=What's an access point?
M6090_S0091_G0130_300_sele=What should I do if I die?
M6090_S0091_G0140_300_sele=Where should I go now?
M6090_S0091_G0150_300_sele=I feel motion sick...
M6090_S0091_G0160_300_sele=This game is too difficult!
M6090_S0091_G0170_300_sele=Request unlocking you-know-what.
M6090_S0091_G0180_300_sele=I'm good.
M6090_S0091_G0190_300_hennawresi=First of all, remember that this game doesn't auto-save.
M6090_S0091_G0191_300_hennawresi=You need to activate that access point over there in order to save.
M6090_S0091_G0192_300_hennawresi=Once you activate a terminal, you can save from anywhere nearby so long as you're within range.
M6090_S0091_G0200_300_hennawresi=When there's a connection icon displayed on the top right of your screen, you can go to the System Menu and quick save.
M6090_S0091_G0201_300_hennawresi=You can also use the access point here to return to that orbiting space station thingy of yours.
M6090_S0091_G0202_300_hennawresi=The other access points are still undergoing maintenance, but you should be able to use them for transport soon.
M6090_S0091_G0210_300_hennawresi=But\u2014and I can't repeat this enough\u2014don't forget that there's no auto-save!
M6090_S0091_G0220_300_hennawresi=Connectivity is limited to certain areas, but you should be able to save in more locations by activating access points.
M6090_S0091_G0230_300_hennawresi=Oh, and let me say it again... There's no auto-save!
M6090_S0091_G0240_300_hennawresi=An access point is a piece of YoRHa equipment.
M6090_S0091_G0250_300_hennawresi=More specifically, it's that thing.
M6090_S0091_G0260_300_hennawresi=You can save and check your mail there.
M6090_S0091_G0270_300_hennawresi=They're all disguised as wrecked vending machines outside the camp.
M6090_S0091_G0280_300_hennawresi=They have a couple other functions, but I guess you'll learn about that when you use 'em.
M6090_S0091_G0290_300_hennawresi=Sometimes enemies will attack terminals. In those cases, you won't be able to use them again until you get rid of the enemies.
M6090_S0091_G0300_300_hennawresi=When you're walking, there should be a mini map on the bottom right. The <MAP_GOAL> icon there shows your next destination.
M6090_S0091_G0310_300_hennawresi=You'll be fine so long as you follow the red marker.
M6090_S0091_G0320_300_hennawresi=...That's a good philosophical question.
M6090_S0091_G0330_300_hennawresi=After a YoRHa body is destroyed, only its memory data is transferred to the new body.
M6090_S0091_G0340_300_hennawresi=That means items aren't transferred\u2014so if you die, you need to recover plug-in chips from your previous body.
M6090_S0091_G0350_300_hennawresi=If you die again before recovering your plug-in chips, they'll all be lost, so take care.
M6090_S0091_G0360_300_hennawresi=Basically, you need to recover everything from your previous body immediately.
M6090_S0091_G0370_300_hennawresi=If you have any system-related questions, ask Maintenance.
M6090_S0091_G0375_300_hennawresi=They handle everything from body maintenance to Pod adjustments.
M6090_S0091_G0380_300_hennawresi=You can change the game difficulty at any time on the System Menu.
M6090_S0091_G0390_300_hennawresi=In Easy mode, enemies are weaker and you can use special auto chips. Equip them and <KC_LOCKON> will activate automatic attacks and evades.
M6090_S0091_G0400_300_hennawresi=Normal mode is a standard level of difficulty.
M6090_S0091_G0410_300_hennawresi=The enemy gets stronger in Hard mode and you can't use any lock-on features.
M6090_S0091_G0420_300_hennawresi=In Very Hard mode, not only is lock-on disabled, but the enemies are... Well, they're kind of insane.
M6090_S0091_G0430_300_hennawresi=It's almost stupid difficult, but more daring players seem to like it.
M6090_S0091_G0431_300_hennawresi=And hey, just between you and me, if you go to "Intel" and select "Tutorials," you may find out some things you didn't know.
M6090_S0091_G0432_300_hennawresi=May be worth checking out if you're ever bored out of your skull!
M6090_S0091_G0440_300_hennawresi=Oh, it's you.
M6090_S0091_G0450_300_hennawresi=The truth is, I've opened a little side business. Gotta be real hush-hush about it though.
M6090_S0091_G0460_300_hennawresi=See, there are certain...accolades given to a select few who really give their all. You know what I'm getting at.
M6090_S0091_G0470_300_hennawresi=They're super tough to earn, which frustrates a lot of androids.
M6090_S0091_G0480_300_hennawresi=So, with the help of some select volunteers, my company unlocks them.
M6090_S0091_G0490_300_hennawresi=It's a secret, but check it out if you like...
M6090_S0091_G0500_300_hennamresi=Ahh, this is amazing... This head is...amazing!
M6090_S0091_G0510_300_hennamresi=Put this on, and you can see the whole world!
M6090_S0091_G0520_300_hennamresi=Ask me something! Anything! I'm omniscient, I'm omnipotent, fire a question at me!
M6090_S0091_G0530_300_hennamresi=You can ask me questions any time you want.
M6090_S0091_G0531_300_hennamresi=Ooooh....You're a Scanner, aren't you?
M6090_S0091_G0532_300_hennamresi=I know everything...
M6090_S0091_G0533_300_hennamresi=...Okay, maybe not EVERYTHING, but you can ask me anything you want to know about hacking.
M6090_S0091_G0534_300_hennamresi=Ask me something again, sometime, okay? Promise?
M6090_S0091_G0535_300_hennamresi=Go on, ask me about something. Like, I dunno, hacking?
M6090_S0091_G0540_300_hennamresi=Ask me a question! Ask me a question! Come ooooon!
M6090_S0091_G0550_300_hennamresi=Come back and ask me something if you're on your own. It gets so lonely!
M6090_S0091_G0560_300_sele=Reading mail is inconvenient.
M6090_S0091_G0570_300_sele=It's hard to see the 3D map...
M6090_S0091_G0580_300_sele=What's the currency in this world?
M6090_S0091_G0590_300_sele=What's a black box?
M6090_S0091_G0595_300_sele=Teach me about hacking.
M6090_S0091_G0600_300_sele=I don't have any questions.
M6090_S0091_G0610_300_hennamresi=Well, it's true that you can only read mail at access points.
M6090_S0091_G0620_300_hennamresi=Also, you can't send mail directly to other YoRHa units\u2014that's to prevent secret information from getting out.
M6090_S0091_G0630_300_hennamresi=Still, there are a lot of androids who use mail because they like how retro it is. Kind of a hipster thing, I guess.
M6090_S0091_G0640_300_hennamresi=Ah, that's where satellite information is put into map data.
M6090_S0091_G0650_300_hennamresi=The satellite camera doesn't have very good resolution, so you can't see fine details or tell what's underground.
M6090_S0091_G0660_300_hennamresi=Other androids are also dissatisfied with it, but that's the way it is, I'm afraid.
M6090_S0091_G0670_300_hennamresi=Some choose to walk on their own two feet and discover things for themselves... Hint, hint!
M6090_S0091_G0680_300_hennamresi=You'll just have to get used to it.
M6090_S0091_G0690_300_hennamresi=Basically, we take apart the enemies we destroy, and use their reconstructed parts.
M6090_S0091_G0700_300_hennamresi=It's much easier than digging up the iron ourselves.
M6090_S0091_G0710_300_hennamresi=Worth is decided according to weight of the enemy and value of the parts you obtained. We call that unit 'G'.
M6090_S0091_G0720_300_hennamresi=...Huh? What does 'G' stand for?
M6090_S0091_G0730_300_hennamresi=Sorry! That's classified.
M6090_S0091_G0740_300_hennamresi=You're asking me? It's something you YoRHa have inside you. I'm not that familiar with it.
M6090_S0091_G0750_300_hennamresi=The black box is a fusion reactor installed in all YoRHa units.
M6090_S0091_G0760_300_hennamresi=But we Resistance folks don't know much about its construction. Apparently it uses some kind of mysterious material...
M6090_S0091_G0770_300_hennamresi=Say, maybe you'd let me rip it out of you and take it apart for analysis!
M6090_S0091_G0780_300_hennamresi=...No? Hey, fair enough. Can't blame a guy for trying.
M6090_S0091_G0790_300_hennamresi=Since you're a Scanner, if you get close to an enemy, <KC_HEAVY_ATK> should appear. ...Er, I think.
M6090_S0091_G0800_300_hennamresi=You can start hacking by pressing and holding <KC_HEAVY_ATK>, but there's a secret trick you can do as well.
M6090_S0091_G0810_300_hennamresi=If you sneak up behind the enemies without being detected and hack into them...
M6090_S0091_G0820_300_hennamresi=You can take over their systems and control them remotely!
M6090_S0091_G0830_300_hennamresi=Not only that, but if you use that enemy to hack another, you can keep taking over one enemy after the next!
M6090_S0091_G0840_300_hennamresi=You can even use them to disguise yourself as a machine when infiltrating areas they control.
M6090_S0091_G0850_300_hennamresi=Give it a try sometime if you're interested.
