M1090_S0100_G0000_101_pascal=Well, THAT was certainly something.
M1090_S0100_G0010_101_pascal=I had no idea such a vast space existed beneath the abandoned factory!
M1090_S0100_G0020_101_pascal=I need to return and investigate as soon as possible.
M1090_S0100_G0030_101_pascal=When I do, perhaps you'd be willing to join me?
M1090_S0100_G0040_101_a2b=No thanks.
M1090_S0100_G0050_101_a2b=I'm heading back to the Resistance camp.
M1090_S0100_G0060_101_a2b=What about you?
M1090_S0100_G0070_101_pascal=Oh, I'll probably wander back to the village. I have plenty on my plate there.
M1090_S0100_G0080_101_a2b=I see.
M1090_S0100_G0090_101_ane=This...Resistan...camp!
M1090_S0100_G0100_101_a2b=Say again? I'm not receiving.
M1090_S0100_G0110_101_pod042=Scanning for interference.
M1090_S0100_G0120_101_ane=...Machines......!
M1090_S0100_G0130_101_ane=Requesting...backup...forces! Please......
M1090_S0100_G0140_101_a2b=Let's move.
M1090_S0100_G0150_101_a2b=Why are their numbers increasing like this?
M1090_S0100_G0160_101_pod042=Cause unknown.
M1090_S0100_G0170_101_a2b=Try contacting the Bunker via laser relay system.
M1090_S0100_G0180_101_pod042=Affirmative.
M1090_S0120_G0001_101_resiman=No... Nooooo!
M1090_S0120_G0002_101_resiwoman2=Somebody help me!
M1090_S0120_G0003_101_resiman=Get out of here now!
