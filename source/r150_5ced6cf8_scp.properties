M1020_S0010_G0120_001_resi=Things have been dangerous around here lately.
M1020_S0010_G0130_001_resi=One of our teams came under attack just the other day.
M1020_S0010_G0140_001_resi=Who knows what'll happen to us next?
M1020_S0010_G0150_001_resi=You jerks be careful in the desert, yeah? Folks die out there.
M1020_S0010_G0160_001_resi=You're from YoRHa, right? I've heard about you guys.
M1020_S0010_G0170_001_resi=We've got a squadmate waiting in a rocky stretch up ahead. Head on over.
M1020_S0010_G0180_001_resi=Just remember that there's nowhere to resupply out there.
M1020_S0010_G0190_001_resi=If you need anything, best to take care of it here while you can.
M1020_S0010_G0250_001_resi=Don't go trying to be a hero, all right?
M1020_S0010_G0260_001_resi=Hey, welcome back!
M1020_S0010_G0270_001_resi=Thanks for securing access to those desert resources.\nIt's a huge help.
M1020_S0010_G0280_001_resi=I know it isn't much, but please take this. It's the least I can do.
M1020_S0010_G0290_001_resi=Oh, and be sure to swing by if you ever need anything, all right?
M1020_S0010_G0300_001_resi=What can I help you with?
M1020_S0010_G0310_001_resi=I hear you kicked some tin-can ass out in the desert.
M1020_S0010_G0320_001_resi=So I guess...you know. Thanks or whatever.
M5150_S0030_G0080_001_ys=That drug... S-So wonderful... Everything feels amaaaaazing... Heeee hee hee...
M5150_S0030_G0090_001_ys=Drug... More drug... Can't stop fighting... So fuuuuun...
M5150_S0030_G0100_001_pod042=Analysis: Unusual unit behavior is directly correlated to the stimulating effects of the combat substance.
M5150_S0030_G0110_001_a2b=They're abusing it.
M5150_S0030_G0120_001_a2b=Or maybe their lives are just too hard to fathom without it.
M5150_S0030_G0130_001_pod153=Analysis: Unusual unit behavior is directly correlated to the stimulating effects of the combat substance.
M5150_S0030_G0140_001_a9s=They're abusing it.
M5150_S0030_G0150_001_a9s=Or maybe their lives are just too hard to fathom without it.

M5590_S0050_G0360_001_resistance=I wonder what kind of civilization used to exist here...
M6030_S0010_G0000_300_ys=We're investigating this area.
M6030_S0010_G0010_300_ys=I know we both have serious missions to do, so let's give it our all.
M6030_S0010_G0020_300_ys=Looks like we can use this oil field as a resource.
M6030_S0010_G0030_300_ys=If we can minimize machine activity in the desert area, we'll be able to transport the oil safely.
M6030_S0010_G0040_300_ys=It may be unexciting work, but if it can help save even a single ally, I'll do whatever it takes.
M6030_S0010_G0050_300_ys=Hey, you! What are you doing here? What happened to your mission?
M6030_S0010_G0060_300_ys=...Who, me? Oh, I'm just lost. Ha! Sorry if I startled you.
M6030_S0010_G0070_300_ys=This is the only area with fresh water, and there's vegetation growing too.
M6030_S0010_G0080_300_ys=Even androids have trouble living in this environment, yet here these plants are. Isn't nature amazing?
M6030_S0010_G0090_300_ys=I'm going to stick around and investigate this place a little more. Don't tell the Commander, okay?
M6030_S0010_G0100_300_robowoman=Oh! Hello.
M6030_S0010_G0110_300_robowoman=How are you?
M6030_S0010_G0120_300_n02=Why are you here?
M6030_S0010_G0130_300_n02=Outsider!
M6030_S0010_G0140_300_n02=Freak!
M6030_S0010_G0150_300_n02=Did you come from the outside?
M6030_S0010_G0160_300_sp=Oh, it's you. Hey, thanks for securing access to those desert resources. It's been a huge help.
M6030_S0010_G0170_300_sp=Here to do a little business?
M6030_S0010_G0180_300_sp=Come back any time.
M6030_S0010_G0190_300_ys=We've been charged with sending resources from here to the bunker.
M6030_S0010_G0200_300_ys=This is a harsh environment for androids.
M6030_S0010_G0210_300_ys=Welp, nothing for it! Better just concentrate on the task at hand, right?
M6030_S0010_G0220_300_ys=I hear you defeated the machines.
M6030_S0010_G0230_300_ys=You're amazing! I wish I was as strong as you...
M6030_S0010_G0240_300_ys=Hello.
M6030_S0010_G0250_300_ys=The Commander ordered me to check out this area. There's not much going on\u2014which is just fine by me!
M6030_S0010_G0260_300_ys=I wish all the other areas were like this.
M6030_S0010_G0261_300_js=Yo. Thanks for helping out with my research.
M6030_S0010_G0262_300_js=Thanks for the help.
M6030_S0010_G0263_300_js=Holler at me if you ever need anything.
M6030_S0010_G0270_300_sp=Thanks to you, I have a decent lineup of products.
M6030_S0010_G0280_300_sp=Wanna do business?
M6030_S0010_G0290_300_sp=Come back any time.
M6030_S0010_G0300_300_ys=Progress isn't exactly going as planned.
M6030_S0010_G0310_300_ys=And Command keeps pestering me, so I gotta do something.
M6030_S0010_G0320_300_ys=Siiigh... Why do I always draw the short straw?
M6030_S0010_G0330_300_ys=Hey there! Hope you don't mind, but I've been tracking your activity log.
M6030_S0010_G0340_300_ys=Your success has inspired me to work harder during my own missions!
M6030_S0010_G0350_300_ys=Hello!
M6030_S0010_G0360_300_ys=A flock of birds came to rest their wings here. I wonder if they instinctively knew how to escape the storm?
M6030_S0010_G0370_300_ys=It seems like time moves more slowly here.
M6030_S0010_G0380_300_ys=If you've got nothing to do, why don't you try fishing? Everyone loves settling down for a round by the pond!
M6030_S0010_G0381_300_js=Thanks for the help.
M6030_S0010_G0382_300_js=You know, I've been thinking about something lately.
M6030_S0010_G0383_300_js=Maybe I should look into it...
M6030_S0010_G0390_300_sp=You all in one piece? There weren't many casualties in this area, but we might not be so lucky next time!
M6030_S0010_G0400_300_sp=So then! What can I do ya for?
M6030_S0010_G0410_300_sp=See ya.
M6030_S0010_G0420_300_ys=...Drugs? Yeah, they're pretty crazy. I can't stop fighting!
M6030_S0010_G0430_300_ys=Mission? Whatever... Leave me alone.
M6030_S0010_G0440_300_ys=*huff, huff...*
M6030_S0010_G0450_300_ys=...Hmm? Drugs? Yeah, they make me feel REALLY WEIRD! ...Wanna try some?
M6030_S0010_G0460_300_ys=Pssst! Hey! Hey, buddy! You need some drugs?
M6030_S0010_G0470_300_ys=See you later... Hee! Heeee hee hee hee...
M6030_S0010_G0480_300_ys=......
M6031_S0011_G0411_300_js=So the Bunker's gone, eh?
M6032_S0012_G0412_300_js=Goddammit, White...
M6033_S0013_G0413_300_js=...Sorry. I had a friend back at the Bunker.
M6033_S0013_G0414_300_js=You're...A2...
M6033_S0013_G0415_300_js=...Never mind. Just be careful out there, yeah?
M6033_S0013_G0416_300_js=Don't really feel like talking now.
