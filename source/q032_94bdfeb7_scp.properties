M5031_S0020_G0100_300_a2b=Now's not the time to be fixing this thing.
M5031_S0030_G0195_001_a9s=Let's see... Four pristine screws and one large gear should be enough to bridge the gap in its memory circuits.
M5031_S0030_G0201_001_a2b=This machine...
M5031_S0030_G0202_001_a9s=You mean this broken hunk of junk? It looks like we can probably get it running again with a little bit of repair work.
M5031_S0030_G0205_001_a2b=Fair enough.
M5032_S0010_G0000_001_a2b=Did you learn anything from the factory data?
M5032_S0010_G0000_300_a2b=We know we can find pristine screws on big bipedal machines, but what about large gears?
M5032_S0010_G0010_001_a9s=Just how it was manufactured. Pretty boring, actually.
M5032_S0010_G0010_300_a9s=Let's try the Operator again.
M5032_S0010_G0020_001_a2b=There's still a lot about machines that we don't understand.
M5032_S0010_G0020_300_a9s=9S to Operator! We're trying to track down a large gear. Any idea where to start the search?
M5032_S0010_G0030_001_a2b=Gather as much data as you can, no matter how irrelevant it may seem.
M5032_S0010_G0030_300_op210=Why are you looking for\u2014? Well, anyway, you can salvage the requested material from smaller machine lifeforms.
M5032_S0010_G0040_300_op210=Finding one intact might prove tricky, however. The part is easily damaged when the machine housing it is destroyed.
M5032_S0010_G0050_001_a9s=Okay. That should be everything we need to repair the machine.
M5032_S0010_G0050_300_a9s=Thanks, Operator. That's good to know.
M5032_S0010_G0055_001_telo=53 minutes later...
M5032_S0010_G0060_300_a2b=Right. Let's go take out some small fry.
M5032_S0010_G0070_300_a9s=Heh. Straight to the point as always, 2B!
M5032_S0010_G0080_300_a2b=We still don't have what we need.
M5032_S0010_G0090_300_a9s=Yeah. Most of the gears were too damaged to use.
M5032_S0010_G0100_300_a2b=Surely just a LITTLE damage won't hurt?
M5032_S0010_G0110_300_a9s=Come on now, 2B.
M5032_S0020_G0000_001_a9s=Let's see what we've got.
M5032_S0020_G0010_001_eng=My name is Engels, serial number 110-B.
M5032_S0020_G0020_001_a9s=Whoa!
M5032_S0020_G0030_001_eng=I was manufactured in February of the human calendar year 11,934 A.D.
M5032_S0020_G0040_001_eng=My first deployment was in August of that same year.
M5032_S0020_G0050_001_eng=Requesting confirmation of current status.
M5032_S0020_G0060_001_a9s=This thing's getting chattier.
M5032_S0020_G0070_001_eng=Requesting confirmation of current status.
M5032_S0020_G0080_001_a9s=Um...well, you were defeated by us androids. That's why you can't move.
M5032_S0020_G0090_001_a9s=At this point, you should probably just hand over any classified information in your possession.
M5032_S0020_G0100_001_eng=Understood.
M5032_S0020_G0110_001_a9s=That was surprisingly easy.
M5032_S0020_G0120_001_eng=My mission has already been accomplished. My commander is absent.
M5032_S0020_G0130_001_eng=I have no orders to withhold classified information.
M5032_S0020_G0140_001_eng=But as a combat weapon, I do not possess a great deal of data.
M5032_S0020_G0150_001_eng=You should not expect much.
M5032_S0020_G0160_001_a9s=We'll keep that in mind.
M5032_S0020_G0170_001_eng=Thank you for saving me.
M5032_S0020_G0180_001_a2b=That's not quite what's happening here.
M5032_S0020_G0190_001_eng=Please visit me again.
M5032_S0020_G0200_001_a2b=Why?
M5032_S0020_G0210_001_eng=Because I have nothing to do.
M5032_S0020_G0220_001_a9s=Are you trying to say you're bored?
M5032_S0020_G0230_001_a9s=What a strange machine...
M5920_S0010_G0280_001_pod042=Target location data obtained. Marking on map.
M5920_S0020_G0280_001_pod153=Target location data obtained. Marking on map.
