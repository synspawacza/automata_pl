M1060_S0010_G0092_001_a9s=Why are some machines so aggressive, while others couldn't care less about us?
M1060_S0040_G0000_001_a9s=The bedrock here was bombed out in the last war.

M1060_S0040_G0012_001_a2b=Is that what we need to protect?
M1060_S0040_G0020_001_a9s=Let's take 'em out already so I can be home in time for dinner and a bath!
M1060_S0040_G0030_001_a2b=Androids don't need to bathe.
M1060_S0040_G0040_001_a2b=As long as you perform regular cleaning and maintenance, bathing is unnecessary.
M1060_S0040_G0050_001_a9s=Yeah, but come on, 2B, it still FEELS good!
M1060_S0040_G0060_001_a9s=I think that's the last of the machines.

M1060_S0040_G0110_001_cmd=It's currently being engaged by a swarm of machines.
M1060_S0040_G0120_001_cmd=I've asked all YoRHa troops in the city ruins for assistance, and I'll need you to provide backup as well.
M1060_S0040_G0130_001_cmd=I'm sending flight units and coordinates now.
M1060_S0040_G0140_001_cmd=Good luck. Out.
