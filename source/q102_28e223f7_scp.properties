M5102_S0010_G0000_001_robomaster=How good of you to grace Father Servo with your presence once again.
M5102_S0010_G0000_300_robomaster=Care ye to taste the results of Father Servo's latest modification?
M5102_S0010_G0010_001_robomaster=Such drive is admirable.
M5102_S0010_G0020_001_robomaster=Well then! Do you care to witness the glories of this latest modification?
M5102_S0010_G0030_001_sele=Witness the glories.
M5102_S0010_G0030_300_robomaster=Would you like to help Father Servo with his training?
M5102_S0010_G0040_001_sele=Pass on witnessing the glories.
M5102_S0010_G0040_300_sele=Begin anew.
M5102_S0010_G0050_001_robomaster=The Father Servo you knew has passed from this life, my child. Behold his latest incarnation!
M5102_S0010_G0050_300_sele=Begin nothing.
M5102_S0010_G0060_001_robomaster=A pity.
M5102_S0010_G0060_300_robomaster=Father Servo will not waste his talents on a weakened foe! Begone!
M5102_S0010_G0070_001_robomaster=Come find Father Servo if you change your mind.
M5102_S0010_G0080_001_robomaster=Such strength can only be achieved by becoming one with the universe!
M5102_S0010_G0090_001_robomaster=If you desire to test yourself anew, Father Servo is happy to oblige.
M5102_S0010_G0090_300_robomaster=Have you brought the required items?
M5102_S0010_G0100_001_robomaster=No more! Father Servo yields!
M5102_S0010_G0100_300_sele=Surrender the items.
M5102_S0010_G0110_001_a9s=So what do you want this time? More weird junk?
M5102_S0010_G0110_300_sele=Turn him down.
M5102_S0010_G0120_001_robomaster=To business already? My my!
M5102_S0010_G0130_001_a9s=Figured I should get it over with and save us both some time.
M5102_S0010_G0140_001_robomaster=You're a clever one, aren't you?
M5102_S0010_G0150_001_robomaster=Well, when the heavens offer succor, it is poor form to refuse. Father Servo requires a silver ore, a pristine screw, and a broken battery.
M5102_S0010_G0160_001_a9s=Hold on. That's more stuff than last time!
M5102_S0010_G0170_001_robomaster=ERROR. ERROR. BAD FILE OR PATHWAY. BZZZZZT.
M5102_S0010_G0180_001_a9s=Stop it! I know you're not broken!
M5102_S0010_G0190_001_a2b=Let's go already.
M5102_S0010_G0200_001_robomaster=Father Servo needs a silver ore, a pristine screw, and a broken battery.
M5102_S0020_G0000_001_a9s=We've got what you wanted. Pretty much needed a wheelbarrow to carry it all... *grumble*
M5102_S0020_G0010_001_robomaster=Thank you, my child.
M5102_S0020_G0020_001_robomaster=With these items, the flesh of Father Servo will be so, so, so, so, SO powerful!
M5102_S0020_G0030_001_a9s=Good. Because I'm going to beat you silly next time to make up for all your stupid errands.
M5102_S0020_G0040_001_robomaster=Er, yes. Regardless, modifying one's body is not a process accomplished quickly or without effort.
M5102_S0020_G0050_001_robomaster=So until your next visit, farewell!
