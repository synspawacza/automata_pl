M5900_S0010_G0000_001_eml=Wow, you've sure gotten strong! I doubt you'll be needing my help anymore.
M5900_S0010_G0010_001_a2b=What do you mean?
M5900_S0010_G0020_001_a9s=What do you mean?
M5900_S0010_G0030_001_a2=What do you mean?
M5900_S0010_G0040_001_eml=Um, nothing. Don't worry about it. Take care now!
M5900_S0010_G0050_001_a2b=Emil sure is acting odd.

M5900_S0010_G0080_001_a2b=Nice work.
M5900_S0010_G0090_001_a9s=Emil sure is acting kind of weird.

M5900_S0010_G0120_001_a9s=Heh. Nice work. Let's go find him.
M5900_S0010_G0130_001_a2=That round guy is acting kind of strange.
M5900_S0010_G0140_001_a2=Pod\u2014
M5900_S0010_G0150_001_pod042=Pursuit marker placed on map. Target is heading toward the desert.
M5900_S0010_G0160_001_a2=Huh. Maybe you're not totally useless after all.
M5900_S0020_S0000_001_a2b=Are these... Emil?
M5900_S0020_S0010_001_a9s=Are these... Emil?

M5900_S0110_G0120_001_eml=Years of multiplying...  Years of fighting in wars... Their sense of self just...deteriorated.
M5900_S0110_G0130_001_eml=I need to settle things with them. On my own.
