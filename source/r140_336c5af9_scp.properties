M5250_S0010_G0000_001_pascal=Hello, 9S. What's on your mind?
M5250_S0010_G0010_001_a9s=I wanted to ask you something.
M5250_S0010_G0020_001_sele=Ask about being pacifists.
M5250_S0010_G0030_001_sele=Ask about life in the village.
M5250_S0010_G0040_001_sele=Ask about the shop.
M5250_S0010_G0050_001_pascal=Ah... You wish to know the reason we in the village detest fighting?
M5250_S0010_G0060_001_pascal=Well, it's a bit of a heady concept, but in the end, I suppose it's because conflict has ceased to have meaning for us.
M5250_S0010_G0070_001_a9s=Care to explain?
M5250_S0010_G0080_001_pascal=We machines are weapons created for the purpose of waging war. However, this war simply goes on and on with no end in sight.
M5250_S0010_G0090_001_pascal=We have come to realize that the cost of fighting for us as individuals far outweighs any benefits that victory might bring.
M5250_S0010_G0100_001_pascal=I believe we will eventually live to see a day when androids and machine lifeforms are able to live together in peace.
M5250_S0010_G0110_001_a9s=Not likely.
M5250_S0010_G0120_001_pascal=Do you mean our day-to-day existence?
M5250_S0010_G0130_001_pascal=Well, as you know, we are machines. We do not require food or other typical sustenance, as our cores provide a near-infinite supply of energy.
M5250_S0010_G0140_001_pascal=We do, however, deteriorate over time, which means we need to procure parts and initiate repairs.
M5250_S0010_G0150_001_pascal=Still, it's not like we break down all that often. To be completely honest, life in the village is rather slow.
M5250_S0010_G0160_001_a9s=Why is there a shop in your village, Pascal? It's not like you folks use money.
M5250_S0010_G0170_001_pascal=Oh, we do. For us, simple materials take the role of currency.
M5250_S0010_G0180_001_pascal=Each machine is an equal, which means the traditional capitalistic acquisition systems of the past don't work for us. Instead, our economy is focused on trading materials according to one's need.
M5250_S0010_G0190_001_pascal=It was a lesson we learned from mankind's past history. Most fascinating, don't you think?
M5250_S0010_G0200_001_pascal=We've made it a point of emphasis to teach our children about different economic systems. You should speak to them if the subject is of further interest.
M5250_S0010_G0210_001_a9s=Heh. That looks like fun. Whatcha doing?
M5250_S0010_G0220_001_robochildrenA=This kid's being weird!
M5250_S0010_G0230_001_robochildrenB=Yeah! I asked if he wanted a coin that's low value or one that's high value, and he said he wanted the worthless one!
M5250_S0010_G0240_001_a9s=Seriously?
M5250_S0010_G0250_001_a9s=Hey, kid. I've got one coin that's worth a little and one that's worth a lot. Which one do you want?
M5250_S0010_G0260_001_robostrange=UMMMM...THE LITTLE ONE!
M5250_S0010_G0270_001_a9s=You sure about that?
M5250_S0010_G0280_001_robostrange=YEAH, 'CAUSE IT LOOKS COOL. HEE HEE! THANKS A LOT!
M5250_S0010_G0290_001_robochildrenA=See? He's weird!
M5250_S0010_G0300_001_robochildrenB=Yeah. What a dummy!
M5250_S0010_G0310_001_robostrange=I'M A DUMMY? HEE HEE! THANKS A LOT!
M5250_S0010_G0320_001_a9s=Hmm. This little guy might have a bad mathematical processor. Or maybe his logic circuits got crossed somehow...
M5250_S0010_G0330_001_a9s=I should probably take a look inside.
M5250_S0010_G0340_001_a9s=Wow, this is more complex than I was expecting. Let me try again...
M5250_S0010_G0350_001_a9s=Hmm...
M5250_S0010_G0360_001_robostrange=......
M5250_S0010_G0370_001_a9s=If your logic circuits are this advanced, why are you behaving like that?
M5250_S0010_G0380_001_robostrange=Well, I suppose there's no point in pretending anymore.
M5250_S0010_G0390_001_robostrange=It's simple, really: If I pretend to prefer smaller denominations of coins, the people around me are so entertained, they keep giving them to me.
M5250_S0010_G0400_001_robostrange=In this fashion, I'm able to earn far more than I would if I asked for larger units of currency.
M5250_S0010_G0410_001_robostrange=There's an important lesson here: The more of a fool people take you for, the more you'll learn of their true nature.
M5250_S0010_G0420_001_robostrange=Oh, but keep this between us for now, all right? I need them to keep thinking that I'm slow.
M5250_S0010_G0430_001_robostrange=Here's a little hush money to smooth things over.
M5250_S0010_G0440_001_a9s=I'm not sure I even know what it means to be smart anymore.
M5250_S0010_G0450_001_pod153=Reply unknown. Terms are too vague to formulate a reasoned response.
M5250_S0010_G0460_001_a9s=Heh. Don't I know it...
