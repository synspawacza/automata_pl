M5071_S0010_G0000_001_n02=OH NO... OH NO...
M5071_S0010_G0010_001_a2b=What is it?
M5071_S0010_G0020_001_n02=A MOOSE I HAVE BEEN CARING FOR HAS FALLEN ILL.
M5071_S0010_G0030_001_n02=I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO REPAIR IT.
M5071_S0010_G0040_001_a9s=You don't "repair" animals like you do a machine.
M5071_S0010_G0050_001_a9s=But if it's sick, you should try giving it some medicine.
M5071_S0010_G0060_001_n02=MEDI...CINE? I AM NOT FAMILIAR WITH THIS CONCEPT.
M5071_S0010_G0070_001_a9s=Yeah, I suppose you wouldn't be.
M5071_S0010_G0080_001_a9s=It'll probably be easiest to just bring you some. Try to hang on until then, all right?
M5071_S0010_G0090_001_a2b=So we're vets now? That's new.
M5071_S0010_G0100_001_a2b=I assume you have at least some idea where to start looking for animal medication?
M5071_S0010_G0110_001_a9s=We'll probably need to recreate old human recipes.
M5071_S0010_G0120_001_a9s=We should be able to find something in the commercial facility ruins.
M5071_S0020_G0000_001_a2b=What's this?
M5071_S0020_G0010_001_pod042=Analysis: That is a hygienic tool known as a "toothbrush."
M5071_S0020_G0020_001_pod042=Humans moved it back and forth across the teeth at a rapid rate to reduce the probability of cavities.
M5071_S0020_G0030_001_a2b=Cavities? As in caves?
M5071_S0020_G0040_001_pod042=Cavities are bits of decayed enamel caused by acids in the mouth. The cave analogy is not altogether inaccurate.
M5071_S0020_G0050_001_a9s=Hmm. Well, it's got nothing to do with us.
M5071_S0020_G0060_001_a2b=Never seen this before.
M5071_S0020_G0070_001_pod042=Analysis: That is a waxy solid known as "lipstick." Humans applied it to their lips in order to appear more attractive.
M5071_S0020_G0080_001_a2b=How odd.
M5071_S0020_G0090_001_pod042=Proposal: Applying it to your own lips might lead to a further understanding of human customs.
M5071_S0020_G0100_001_a2b=No thanks.
M5071_S0020_G0110_001_a2b=Here's something else.
M5071_S0020_G0120_001_pod042=Analysis: That is a form of sustenance known as "extreme weight-loss superfood."
M5071_S0020_G0130_001_pod042=Humans consumed it in place of more traditional edibles in order to reduce body mass.
M5071_S0020_G0140_001_a2b=Why would they want to do that?
M5071_S0020_G0150_001_pod042=Humans often took in more energy than they expended.
M5071_S0020_G0160_001_pod042=Accumulated calories were converted to fat and stored, decreasing physical capabilities.
M5071_S0020_G0170_001_a9s=Man, humans had it rough...
M5071_S0020_G0180_001_a2b=Pod, what's this?
M5071_S0020_G0190_001_pod042=Analysis: It is a writing implement. Humans used it to record information.
M5071_S0020_G0200_001_pod042=Many humans also believed pens were mightier than swords.
M5071_S0020_G0210_001_a2b=That's insane.
M5071_S0020_G0220_001_pod042=It was a common human idiom. Meaning unclear.
M5071_S0020_G0230_001_pod042=Alert: Organic pharmacology textbook discovered.
M5071_S0020_G0240_001_pod042=The data contained within should prove effective for ungulates such as moose.
M5071_S0020_G0250_001_pod042=Page 278 contains a recipe for an anti-inflammation analgesic which has a high probability of\u2014
M5071_S0020_G0260_001_a9s=Whoa whoa whoa! Hold on.
M5071_S0020_G0270_001_a9s=We haven't even cracked this thing open yet! How do you know what's in it?
M5071_S0020_G0280_001_pod042=The contents of this book are contained in my internal database.
M5071_S0020_G0290_001_a9s=WHAT!? Why didn't you tell us that when we first started looking for it!?
M5071_S0020_G0300_001_pod042=A request for information was not submitted.
M5071_S0020_G0310_001_a9s=Well, this has been a glorious waste of time.
M5071_S0020_G0320_001_a2b=Let's just make the medicine and get it back to that machine.
M5071_S0030_G0000_001_n02=MEDICINE!
M5071_S0030_G0010_001_n02=THANK YOU. I WILL ADMINISTER IT IMMEDIATELY.
M5071_S0030_G0020_001_n02=...THE MEDICINE SEEMS TO HAVE WORKED. SHE IS SLEEPING SOUNDLY.
M5071_S0030_G0030_001_a2b=Good to hear.
M5071_S0030_G0040_001_n02=ANIMALS ARE STRANGE CREATURES.
M5071_S0030_G0050_001_n02=UNLIKE US, THEY CANNOT BE EASILY REPAIRED.
M5071_S0030_G0060_001_n02=IT MUST BE DIFFICULT TO POSSESS SUCH INCONVENIENT BODIES.
M5071_S0030_G0070_001_n02=HOWEVER...
M5071_S0030_G0080_001_n02=UNLIKE US, THEY ARE ALSO WARM.
M5071_S0030_G0090_001_a2b=So I've heard.
M5071_S0030_G0100_001_n02=BEFORE I FORGET.
M5071_S0030_G0110_001_n02=PLEASE TAKE THIS AS PAYMENT FOR THE MEDICINE.
M5071_S0030_G0120_001_n02=COME AGAIN. WE WILL BE WAITING.
