M5910_S0100_G0172_001_pod042=Good morning, A2.
M5910_S0100_G0173_001_a2=What the...?
M5910_S0100_G0174_001_pod042=Analysis: YoRHa unit A2 was restarted five minutes and forty-two seconds ago.
M5910_S0100_G0175_001_pod042=The cause was excessive strain due to battle against a large machine lifeform.
M5910_S0200_G0000_001_a2=All this goddamn sand is starting to piss me off.
M5910_S0200_G0010_001_pod042=Alert: Fuel filter performance deteriorating.
M5910_S0200_G0020_001_pod042=Fine particulate matter seems to have entered the filter while fighting in the desert.
M5910_S0200_G0030_001_pod042=Proposal: Replace the faulty part immediately.
M5910_S0200_G0040_001_a2=You make it sound so easy.
M5910_S0200_G0050_001_pod042=Records indicate said part was once used at the Resistance camp.
M5910_S0200_G0060_001_a2=The Resistance camp...
M5910_S0200_G0070_001_pod042=It is located at\u2014
M5910_S0200_G0080_001_a2=I know where it is.
M5910_S0200_G0271_001_toolshop=You need a fuel filter? Sorry, but I'm all out!
M5910_S0200_G0272_001_toolshop=You'll have to ask Anemone when new stock is going to arrive.
M5910_S0200_G0273_001_kj=A fuel filter? I'm a weapons trader, what are you asking me for!?
M5910_S0200_G0274_001_kj=Try the supply trader.
M5910_S0200_G0275_001_bs=You need a fuel filter? Why don't you ask the supply trader over there?
M5910_S0200_G0280_001_a2=Hey, Anemone. Got a question for you.
M5910_S0200_G0285_001_a2=Any chance you could spare a fuel filter?
M5910_S0200_G0290_001_ane=A fuel filter? I'm afraid our supply recently ran out.
M5910_S0200_G0300_001_ane=Pascal makes them for us, so you could go pick up one directly if you'd like.
M5910_S0200_G0310_001_a2=Pascal!?
M5910_S0200_G0320_001_ane=You know him?
M5910_S0200_G0330_001_a2=You TRADE with the enemy!?
M5910_S0200_G0340_001_ane=His village is different. They've never caused us any harm.
M5910_S0200_G0350_001_a2=No way. Forget it.
M5910_S0200_G0360_001_ane=This may be hard to understand, but we forged an alliance and trade materials when the need arises.
M5910_S0200_G0370_001_ane=We can't be picky about how we reach our goals around here.
M5910_S0200_G0380_001_ane=And besides, we aren't so far gone that we kill machine lifeforms after they surrender.
M5910_S0200_G0390_001_a2=......
M5910_S0200_G0400_001_pod042=Alert: A broken filter will cause significant problems with fuel distribution.
M5910_S0200_G0410_001_pod042=Proposal: Replace the faulty part immediately.
M5910_S0200_G0420_001_a2=Yeah. I know.
M5910_S0200_G0430_001_pod042=Coordinates confirmed for a colony centered around the machine lifeform known as Pascal.
M5910_S0200_G0440_001_pod042=Location marked on map.
M5910_S0200_G0450_001_a2=You don't know when to shut up, do you...
