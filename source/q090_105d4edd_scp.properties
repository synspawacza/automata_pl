M6110_S0010_G0010_001_n02=You defeated all of them!? Congratulations!\nYou still can't pick me though.
M6110_S0020_G0000_001_n02=I guess swords don't go well with small bipedal units after all...
M6110_S0020_G0010_001_n02=We'll throw away our swords! Please teach us!
M6110_S0030_G0000_001_n02=Man, laser guns are so friggin' AWESOME!!\nI'm so glad I got myself modded!
M6110_S0030_G0010_001_n02=We'll give up our guns! Please teach us!
M6110_S0040_G0000_001_n02=Hmmm... So the trick is to get close, and then...
M6110_S0040_G0010_001_n02=Hmmm... Congratulations...
M6110_S0050_G0000_001_n02=My dad's out there right now!\nGo, dad!
M6110_S0050_G0010_001_n02=Congratulations, big guy!\nMy dad's just a referee, but he's a big fan of yours!
M6110_S0060_G0000_001_n02=Hehehe... You lookin' for somethin'?
M6110_S0060_G0010_001_n02=It'd be a shame to let all these parts go to waste, no?
M6110_S0060_G0020_001_n02=Hehehe... Lookin' for a deal?
M6110_S0060_G0030_001_n02=Just don't ask where I get my parts from, okay?
M6110_S0060_G0040_001_n02=Heeheehee... Got lots of stuff on sale!

M6110_S0065_G0000_001_n02=Hm? You wanna know what happened to the merchant?
M6110_S0065_G0010_001_n02=He's friends with one of the spectators here, so why don't you go talk to him?
M6110_S0065_G0020_001_n02=He's a big machine, so he should be easy enough to find.
M6110_S0070_G0000_001_n02=Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!
M6110_S0070_G0010_001_n02=Kill! Kill! Kill! Ki... \nOh hey, 9S! Sup?
M6110_S0080_G0000_001_n02=Grrr! You'd better not lose!
M6110_S0080_G0010_001_n02=Grrr! You'd better not lose! ... Right, 9S?
M6110_S0090_G0000_001_n02=Ugh, no no no no NO. Did you even study theory!?
M6110_S0090_G0010_001_n02=Ugh, no no no no NO. Did you even study 9S's combat data?
M6110_S0100_G0000_001_n02=Loser! What are you, a friggin' android or something!?
M6110_S0100_G0010_001_n02=Loser! Why don't you try learnin' a bit from 9S, huh!?
M6110_S0110_G0000_001_n02=Not bad, but try approaching your opponent from a closer angle!
M6110_S0110_G0010_001_n02=Not bad, but try approaching your opponent like 9S does!
M6110_S0120_G0000_001_n02=Wow, that guy's really strong!
M6110_S0120_G0010_001_n02=Wow, that guy's really strong! He must have a bit of 9S in him...
M6110_S0130_G0000_001_n02=Good luck! I'm rooting for all of you!
M6110_S0130_G0010_001_n02=Oh! 9S! You're the only one I'm rooting for!
M6110_S0140_G0000_001_n02=Dance like a butterfly and sting like a bee!
M6110_S0140_G0010_001_n02=Dance like 9S and sting like 9S! \nJust, you know, be like 9S!
M6110_S0150_G0000_001_n02=OH MY GOSH, THIS IS SO EXCITING!
M6110_S0150_G0010_001_n02=OH MY GOSH, IT'S 9S! THIS IS SO EXCITING!
M6110_S0160_G0000_001_n02=Shhh! I'm trying to concentrate on the match!
M6110_S0160_G0010_001_n02=9S! Could you offer your opinion on this match, please?
M6110_S0170_G0000_001_n02=Go! Go! Smash them all to a pulp!
M6110_S0170_G0010_001_n02=Oh, 9S! Did you clear the Special Rank yet?
M6110_S0180_G0000_001_n02=My money's on the small bipedal unit!
M6110_S0180_G0010_001_n02=My money's on 9S!
M6110_S0190_G0000_001_n02=My money's on the large bipedal unit!

M6110_S0210_G0000_001_n02=...I'm rootin' for ya.
M6110_S0210_G0010_001_n02=...I'm rootin' for ya. I'm sure you'll ace the Special Rank too.
M6110_S0220_G0000_001_n02=...What he said.
M6110_S0220_G0010_001_n02=...What he said.
M6110_S0230_G0000_001_n02=Hey, you. You didn't buy anything in the lobby, did ya?
M6110_S0230_G0010_001_n02=You know that guy selling stuff in the lobby?\nHe's an expert fighter.
M6110_S0230_G0020_001_n02=He's been stealing parts from the opponents he defeated to sell them and buy upgrades for himself.
M6110_S0230_G0030_001_n02=He's been tinkering with his ego backup data as well, and I think he's started to get a bit loopy...
M6110_S0230_G0040_001_n02=You may not have noticed, but you actually fought him before.
M6110_S0230_G0050_001_n02=Thanks for taking care of him. And congrats!
