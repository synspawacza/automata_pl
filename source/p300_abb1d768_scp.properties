M3000_S0040_G0000_001_op210=...And those are your orders. Do you understand?
M3000_S0040_G0000_300_op210=The target is thought to be in a high location with good network reception. Try examining the rooftops of buildings.
M3000_S0040_G0010_001_a9s=Um...
M3000_S0040_G0010_300_a9s=Roger.
M3000_S0040_G0020_001_a9s=The Scanners are going to hack into the enemy's anti-air system and shut it down in advance of an all-out assault, right?
M3000_S0040_G0020_300_op210=Please refrain from destroying the target. If you do, another one will simply take its place.
M3000_S0040_G0030_001_op210=That's right. Good job, 9S!
M3000_S0040_G0030_300_a9s=No killing the target. Got it.
M3000_S0040_G0040_001_a9s=Why are you talking to me like I'm a child?
M3000_S0040_G0040_300_op210=Be advised, the target's appearance is identical to that of a standard enemy. Once you approach, however, a marker will appear.
M3000_S0040_G0050_001_op210=What? That must be your imagination.
M3000_S0040_G0050_300_a9s=Is it me, or does it seem like they're getting smarter?
M3000_S0040_G0060_001_op210=Look for machines that are receiving signals from the anti-air system.
M3000_S0040_G0060_300_op210=Hmph! You destroyed it again.
M3000_S0040_G0070_001_op210=They should be located in elevated areas with good signal reception.
M3000_S0040_G0070_300_op210=You have to hack 'em! Hack-hack-hack!\nThey'll substitute another enemy soon, so try again.
M3000_S0040_G0071_001_op210=I've forwarded the general positions of the machine lifeforms you need to hack.
M3000_S0040_G0080_001_a9s=Roger.
M3000_S0040_G0080_300_a9s=Got it.
M3000_S0040_G0090_001_a9s=Whoops!
M3000_S0040_G0090_300_op210=I see your hacking was successful. Way to go!
M3000_S0040_G0100_001_op210=Unit 9S, your orders are to hack in to enemy units, not destroy them.
M3000_S0040_G0100_300_a9s=You're totally treating me like a kid.
M3000_S0040_G0110_001_op210=Destroyed units will simply be replaced. Attacking is pointless.
M3000_S0040_G0110_300_op210=Now move onto the next one!
M3000_S0040_G0120_001_op210=Try to sneak up behind your foes, keep out of sight, and then...
M3000_S0040_G0120_300_a9s=Fiiiine.
M3000_S0040_G0130_001_op210=Boom! Hack 'em up good.
M3000_S0040_G0130_300_op210=Defensive system operation confirmed to be declining.
M3000_S0040_G0140_001_a9s=Um, okay.
M3000_S0040_G0140_300_a9s=Almost there.
M3000_S0040_G0150_001_a9s=..."Boom?" Is she serious?
M3000_S0040_G0150_300_op210=Enemy defense system fully offline.\nI knew you could do it.
M3000_S0040_G0151_001_pod153=Analysis: It is not possible to hack directly into the target Goliath-class machine lifeform.
M3000_S0040_G0152_001_pod153=Special software protection detected. Enemy is refusing access from anything other than machine lifeforms.
M3000_S0040_G0153_001_pod153=Proposal: Unit 9S should commandeer a smaller enemy and use it to hack the large one.
M3000_S0040_G0154_001_a9s=A little multi-level hacking, huh?
M3000_S0040_G0160_001_op210=Looks like it's going well down there.
M3000_S0040_G0160_300_a9s=I-I always do...
M3000_S0040_G0170_001_op210=Every Scanner in the force is involved in this operation.
M3000_S0040_G0170_300_op210=That really was brilliant work, which means I've got a special surprise for you.
M3000_S0040_G0180_001_op210=So let's try not to fall behind.
M3000_S0040_G0180_300_op210=I'll leave it in my room so you can pick it up later.
M3000_S0040_G0190_001_a9s=Yeah, yeah. No falling behind. Got it.
M3000_S0040_G0190_300_a9s=...A surprise?
M3000_S0040_G0200_001_op210=9S?
M3000_S0040_G0210_001_a9s=What is it?
M3000_S0040_G0220_001_op210=Make sure to do whatever is necessary to avoid combat.
M3000_S0040_G0230_001_a9s=And how will I provide support to the squad if I don't fight?
M3000_S0040_G0240_001_op210=Scanner units such as yourself are not designed for battle.
M3000_S0040_G0250_001_a9s=Aw, are you worried about me?
M3000_S0040_G0260_001_op210=No. I'm merely pointing out that you would be a liability on the battlefield.
M3000_S0040_G0270_001_a9s=Wow, that's...harsh.
M3000_S0040_G0280_001_a11s=11S to 9S, come in.
M3000_S0040_G0290_001_a9s=9S here. Go ahead.
M3000_S0040_G0300_001_a11s=I'm just about wrapped up here. How about you?
M3000_S0040_G0310_001_a9s=Um, just one left, I think.
M3000_S0040_G0320_001_a11s=Roger.
M3000_S0040_G0330_001_a11s=Be sure to head back to the Bunker when you're done so you can sync your data.
M3000_S0040_G0340_001_a9s=Oh, right. I forgot about that.
M3000_S0040_G0350_001_a11s=Until your combat data is uploaded, none of the Scanner modules can run updates.
M3000_S0040_G0360_001_a9s=Okay. I'll take care of it as soon as I'm done here.
M3000_S0040_G0370_001_a11s=Appreciated.
M3000_S0050_G0000_001_a9s=Whew... That looks like everything.
M3000_S0050_G0010_001_a9s=Here we go...
M3000_S0050_G0020_001_pod153=Proposal: Unit 9S should rendezvous with unit 2B before the combat situation worsens.
M3000_S0050_G0030_001_a9s=Sounds like a plan.
M3000_S0050_G0040_001_a9s=Lemme just mark the point on the map. Aaaand...there.
M5920_S0020_G0310_001_pod153=Alert: Exiting the planned operational area.
M5920_S0020_G0320_001_pod153=Proposal: Return to the operational area immediately.
