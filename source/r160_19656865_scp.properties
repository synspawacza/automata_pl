M5071_S0030_G0120_001_n02=COME AGAIN. WE WILL BE WAITING.
M5072_S0010_G0000_001_n02=GREETINGS. YOU HAVE RETURNED TO US. HOWEVER...
M5072_S0010_G0010_001_a2b=Let me guess: You need more medicine.
M5072_S0010_G0020_001_n02=NO. EVERYONE HERE IS FINE.
M5072_S0010_G0030_001_n02=BUT, THERE IS A PROBLEM.
M5072_S0010_G0040_001_a9s=What's going on?
M5072_S0010_G0050_001_n02=A PACK OF WILD ANIMALS HAS RECENTLY MIGRATED HERE FROM ELSEWHERE IN THE FOREST.
M5072_S0010_G0060_001_n02=THEY SEEM TO HAVE A STRONG TERRITORIAL INSTINCT.
M5072_S0010_G0070_001_n02=THEY HAVE BEEN INJURING SOME OF THE OTHER NEARBY ANIMALS.
M5072_S0010_G0080_001_n02=SADLY, I DO NOT HAVE THE POWER TO STOP THEM...
M5072_S0010_G0090_001_a2b=I see where this is going.
M5072_S0010_G0100_001_sele=Offer to help.
M5072_S0010_G0110_001_sele=Refuse to help.
M5072_S0010_G0120_001_n02=OF COURSE. THIS IS NOT YOUR PROBLEM, AFTER ALL.
M5072_S0010_G0130_001_n02=I MUST FIGURE OUT A SOLUTION ON MY OWN.
M5072_S0010_G0140_001_n02=IF ONLY I COULD STOP THE WILD ANIMALS FROM ATTACKING...
M5072_S0010_G0150_001_n02=BUT I AM POWERLESS TO HELP...
M5072_S0010_G0160_001_n02=OH! ARE YOU SURE?
M5072_S0010_G0170_001_a9s=We can't just let some pack of animals bully their way in here. Where are they now?
M5072_S0010_G0180_001_n02=THANK YOU! THEY HAVE ADOPTED A CORNER OF THE FOREST AS THEIR LAIR.
M5072_S0010_G0190_001_n02=PLEASE BE CAREFUL...
M5072_S0010_G0200_001_a9s=So it's okay to kill some animals, but not others?
M5072_S0010_G0210_001_a9s=Seems kind of arbitrary, no?
M5072_S0010_G0220_001_a2b=We have no right to judge.
M5072_S0010_G0230_001_a2b=We're soldiers that were created to kill.
M5072_S0010_G0240_001_a9s=Yeah...
M5072_S0010_G0250_001_a2b=Is that...?
M5072_S0010_G0260_001_n02=NNNGH...
M5072_S0010_G0270_001_n02=GRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAGH!
M5072_S0010_G0280_001_a9s=Wow... So the leader of the pack was a machine?
M5072_S0010_G0290_001_a9s=That's the last of them.
M5072_S0010_G0300_001_a9s=Let's go tell that machine that his animal friends are safe.
M5072_S0010_G0310_001_a2b=I've been thinking about the machine who was leading that pack.
M5072_S0010_G0320_001_a9s=Oh yeah?
M5072_S0010_G0330_001_a2b=It seemed less like imitation and more like actual animal behavior.
M5072_S0010_G0340_001_a9s=Yeah, I guess it was kind of odd. You thinking there's a reason for it?
M5072_S0010_G0350_001_a2b=Perhaps.
M5072_S0010_G0360_001_n02=YOU DISPATCHED THE WILD ANIMALS. THANK YOU!
M5072_S0010_G0370_001_n02=NOW WE CAN LIVE HERE IN PEACE.
M5072_S0010_G0380_001_n02=HERE, PLEASE TAKE THIS.
M5072_S0010_G0390_001_a2b=Do you know anything about the machine that was leading the pack?
M5072_S0010_G0400_001_n02=HMM? WHAT MACHINE?
M5072_S0010_G0410_001_a2b=The pack leader was a machine lifeform that seemed to think it was an animal. We couldn't even communicate with it.
M5072_S0010_G0420_001_n02=A MACHINE-TURNED-ANIMAL...
M5072_S0010_G0430_001_n02=I DO NOT KNOW WHAT COULD HAVE CAUSED THIS.
M5072_S0010_G0440_001_n02=BUT I WONDER...WHAT IS LEFT THAT SEPARATES SUCH A MACHINE FROM BEING CALLED AN ANIMAL?
M5072_S0010_G0450_001_a2b=......
M5072_S0010_G0460_001_n02=IN ANY CASE, YOU DISPATCHED THE WILD ANIMALS. YOU HAVE MY THANKS.
M5072_S0010_G0470_001_n02=NOW WE CAN LIVE HERE IN PEACE.
M5072_S0010_G0480_001_n02=HERE, PLEASE TAKE THIS.
M5072_S0010_G0490_001_a9s=Do you know anything about the machine that was leading the pack?
M5072_S0010_G0500_001_n02=HMM? WHAT MACHINE?
M5072_S0010_G0510_001_a9s=The pack leader was a machine lifeform that seemed to think it was an animal.
M5072_S0010_G0520_001_a9s=We couldn't even communicate with it.
M5072_S0010_G0530_001_n02=I SEE... BUT YOU DISPATCHED THEM, YES?
M5072_S0010_G0540_001_n02=IN THAT CASE, ALL IS WELL. ALL IS PEACE!
M5072_S0010_G0550_001_a9s=......
M5072_S0010_G0560_001_a9s=How can you love animals and yet not bat an eye at the death of a fellow machine?
M5072_S0010_G0570_001_a9s=I do not get these guys.
M5072_S0010_G0580_001_a2b=...Yeah.
