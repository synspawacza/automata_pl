M5104_S0010_G0000_001_robomaster=Well? What think you of Father Servo now?
M5104_S0010_G0000_300_robomaster=Dare you face the full brunt of Father Servo's power?
M5104_S0010_G0010_001_a2b=......
M5104_S0010_G0010_300_sele=Face the brunt.
M5104_S0010_G0020_001_a9s=You've, uh, had a lot of work done.
M5104_S0010_G0020_300_sele=Face 180 degrees and walk.
M5104_S0010_G0030_001_robomaster=Indeed! And all thanks to you!
M5104_S0010_G0030_300_robomaster=Would you like to help Father Servo with his training?
M5104_S0010_G0040_001_robomaster=Well then? Think you can face the full might of Father Servo's power?
M5104_S0010_G0040_300_sele=Begin anew.
M5104_S0010_G0050_001_sele=Face the full might of the Father.
M5104_S0010_G0050_300_sele=Begin nothing.
M5104_S0010_G0060_001_sele=Walk away from this nonsense.
M5104_S0010_G0060_300_robomaster=Father Servo will not waste his talents on a weakened foe! Begone!
M5104_S0010_G0070_001_robomaster=Then we fight!
M5104_S0010_G0080_001_robomaster=Ah, a pity. Come find Father Servo if you change your mind.
M5104_S0010_G0090_001_robomaster=Yes! Yesssss! The power of the multiverse courses through the circuits of Father Servo!
M5104_S0010_G0100_001_robomaster=If you desire to test yourself anew, Father Servo is happy to oblige.
M5104_S0010_G0110_001_a9s=Okay. We're done now, right? I mean, this HAS to be the end.
M5104_S0010_G0120_001_robomaster=Oh, my child. How wrong you are. For if Father Servo wishes to be truly strong, he must stake his very life upon it!
M5104_S0010_G0130_001_a2b=Oh, for the love of...
M5104_S0010_G0140_001_robomaster=Grant Father Servo no quarter! This will be a battle to the death!
M5104_S0010_G0150_001_robomaster=Prepare to die, my android child!
M5104_S0010_G0160_001_robomaster=G-Good... Now Father Servo...can be at peace...
M5104_S0010_G0170_001_robomaster=For he has found a foe...strong enough to withstand him...
M5104_S0010_G0180_001_robomaster=Here... Your earthly reward...
M5104_S0010_G0190_001_robomaster=Th-Thank...
M5104_S0010_G0200_001_robomaster=......
M5104_S0010_G0210_001_a9s=Target neutralized. \n...It's over.
M5104_S0010_G0220_001_a2b=Huh.
M5104_S0010_G0230_001_a9s=About goddamn time!
M5104_S0010_G0240_001_a9s=If I ever see that bossy robo-monk again, it'll be too soon, let me tell you.
M5104_S0010_G0250_001_a2b=I suppose.
M5104_S0010_G0260_001_a9s=......
M5104_S0010_G0270_001_a9s=Stupid machine. All he cared about was getting stronger until we finally scrapped him.
M5104_S0010_G0280_001_a9s=But now we don't have to see him ever again. What a relief!
M5104_S0010_G0290_001_a2b=...Indeed.
M5104_S0030_G0010_001_robomaster=......
