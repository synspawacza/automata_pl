M5640_S0010_G0000_001_resistance=Hey, you're with YoRHa, right?
M5640_S0010_G0010_001_resistance=Hmm...
M5640_S0010_G0020_001_resistance=Look, I know this is a bit out of the blue, but can you help me? I've got something of an emergency on my hands.
M5640_S0010_G0030_001_resistance=It seems that some machine lifeforms have stolen several plug-in chips containing classified data.
M5640_S0010_G0040_001_resistance=If they realize what they have, we're going to be in big trouble. You have to help me get 'em back!
M5640_S0010_G0050_001_sele=Lend a hand.
M5640_S0010_G0060_001_sele=Refuse.
M5640_S0010_G0070_001_resistance=Are you serious? That's cold.
M5640_S0010_G0080_001_resistance=I have to get that classified info back from the machines. Please help me out!
M5640_S0010_G0090_001_resistance=Thanks. I have to track down a total of three plug-in chips.
M5640_S0010_G0100_001_resistance=I'll go ahead and send you the signal codes so you can track them.
M5640_S0010_G0110_001_resistance=They're all located somewhere in this city, so hopefully it won't take too long.
M5640_S0010_G0120_001_resistance=Thanks again for the help!

M5640_S0020_G0120_001_pod042=There is no reason for a non-YoRHa android to possess it.
M5640_S0020_G0130_001_a2b=A YoRHa-only chip?

M5640_S0020_G0190_001_a9s=A YoRHa-only chip, huh?

M5640_S0020_G0210_001_pod153=Alert: Incoming message from Command.
M5640_S0020_G0220_001_cmd=All units, be on the lookout for a missing YoRHa in the city ruins.
M5640_S0020_G0230_001_cmd=This unit was in possession of several plug-in chips that contain classified information.
M5640_S0020_G0240_001_cmd=I need you to seek out whatever intel you can regarding their current whereabouts and status.
M5640_S0020_G0250_001_a2b=Roger.
M5640_S0020_G0260_001_a2b=Chips with classified data, is it?
M5640_S0020_G0270_001_a9s=Understood.
M5640_S0020_G0280_001_a9s=Chips with classified data, huh?
M5640_S0050_G0000_001_resistance=Oh man, you really saved my bacon! I'll take those chips from you now.
M5640_S0050_G0010_001_sele=Hand the chips over.
M5640_S0050_G0020_001_sele=Refuse.
M5640_S0050_G0030_001_resistance=Huh? Why not?
M5640_S0050_G0040_001_resistance=You don't actually suspect me of something, do you?
M5640_S0050_G0050_001_resistance=Come on! I need those chips!
M5640_S0050_G0060_001_resistance=Thank you. Oh, and I know this isn't much, but please take it.
M5640_S0050_G0070_001_resistance=I'm glad I can trust you guys. Next time we meet, I'll be sure to introduce you to my family!
M5640_S0050_G0080_001_resistance=You're the guys who got those chips back for me, right? Boy, do I ever owe you one.
M5640_S0050_G0090_001_resistance=Er, I suppose you noticed those chips were YoRHa, huh?
M5640_S0050_G0100_001_resistance=Well, there's a reason for that. Let me introduce you to the new addition to my family.
M5640_S0050_G0110_001_a2b=Your...family?
M5640_S0050_G0120_001_a9s=Your...family?
M5640_S0050_G0130_001_resistance=I always wanted family, you know? Or at least I was pretty sure I did.
M5640_S0050_G0140_001_resistance=Seeing all the machines living together in the same area was starting to make me...lonely.
M5640_S0050_G0150_001_resistance=So I went out and stole a broken-down YoRHa body.
M5640_S0050_G0160_001_resistance=I'm hoping I can repair it and use it to kick off my very own family.
M5640_S0050_G0170_001_ys=H-H-H-Hello?
M5640_S0050_G0180_001_a2b=Unbelievable...
M5640_S0050_G0190_001_a9s=You know this violates all kinds of regulations, right?
M5640_S0050_G0200_001_resistance=I know it isn't right, but I don't care. I need someone I can live with. Someone I can protect.
M5640_S0050_G0210_001_resistance=You won't tell anyone, will you?
M5640_S0050_G0220_001_yolhaS=P-P-P-Pleeee...ase...
M5640_S0050_G0230_001_a2b=......
M5640_S0050_G0240_001_a9s=......
M5640_S0050_G0330_001_a2b=Before I give you the chips, I need you to answer a question.
M5640_S0050_G0340_001_a2b=Do you know anything about a missing YoRHa unit in the area?
M5640_S0050_G0350_001_a9s=Before I give you the chips, I need you to answer a question.
M5640_S0050_G0360_001_a9s=Do you know anything about a missing YoRHa unit in the area?
M5640_S0050_G0370_001_resistance=...No.
M5640_S0050_G0380_001_a2b=You sure?
M5640_S0050_G0390_001_a9s=Really?
M5640_S0050_G0400_001_resistance=Look, just forget about the chips.
M5640_S0050_G0410_001_resistance=See ya.
M5640_S0050_G0420_001_resistance=What? You feel like giving me those plug-in chips now?
