M1020_S0950_G0010_001_a2b=What the hell just happened?
M1020_S0950_G0020_001_a9s=I know! I've never seen a machine like that before.
M1020_S0950_G0030_001_a9s=We'd better report this to Command.
M1020_S0950_G0031_001_pod042=Alert: High-flow areas may impede movement.
M1020_S0950_G0032_001_pod042=It would be more efficient to traverse the rocky area instead.
M1020_S0950_G0130_300_a9s=It stopped. Looks like we're safe now.
M1030_S0010_G0000_001_a9s=Let's move to an area with better reception so we can contact Command.
M1030_S0010_G0010_001_a9s=Okay, this is good. We should be able to reach Command here.
M1030_S0010_G0020_001_a9s=9S to Bunker, do you copy?
M1030_S0010_G0030_001_op210=I read you, 9S. Go ahead.
M1030_S0010_G0040_001_a9s=Operator, we uh... We just encountered a pair of humanoid machines.
M1030_S0010_G0050_001_a9s=We weren't able to capture them...
M1030_S0010_G0060_001_a9s=But I have combat data ready for upload.
M1030_S0010_G0070_001_op210=Understood. Ready to receive.
M1030_S0010_G0080_001_a9s=Hopefully you can get something out of it.
M1030_S0010_G0081_001_a9s=Whew. I think we've earned a breather.
M1030_S0010_G0082_001_a9s=Say, 2B? I was hoping we could talk about our next move.
M1030_S0010_G0083_001_a9s=I'm worried about the damage we took in that last battle with the machines.
M1030_S0010_G0084_001_a9s=Maybe we should return to the Resistance camp to resupply and conduct maintenance?
M1030_S0010_G0085_001_sele=Return to the Resistance camp.
M1030_S0010_G0086_001_sele=Continue fighting.
M1030_S0010_G0087_001_a2b=All right. Let's go back.
M1030_S0010_G0088_001_a9s=You got it.
M1030_S0010_G0089_001_a2b=No. We should keep fighting.
M1030_S0010_G0090_001_op210=Operator to 9S: Data upload complete.
M1030_S0010_G0091_001_a9s=Roger that. Just try not to overdo it, okay?
M1030_S0010_G0100_001_a9s=Roger.
M1030_S0010_G0110_001_op210=I also have an incoming message from the Commander.
M1030_S0010_G0120_001_op210=Initiating playback.
M1030_S0010_G0130_001_cmd=2B? 9S? We've lost contact with several YoRHa units that were on their way to the surface.
M1030_S0010_G0140_001_cmd=Their black boxes are online, so we presume they're still alive.
M1030_S0010_G0150_001_cmd=We've tracked the location of their signals,
M1030_S0010_G0160_001_cmd=so I need all YoRHa units on the surface to head over and investigate.
M1030_S0010_G0170_001_op210=End transmission.
M1030_S0010_G0180_001_a2b=Hmm. I heard something about that back at the Resistance camp.
M1030_S0010_G0190_001_a9s=Target location confirmed.
M1030_S0010_G0200_001_a9s=I'm worried about the other androids...
M1030_S0010_G0210_001_a9s=We should probably check this out as soon as possible.
M1030_S0050_G0000_001_a9s=So, 2B\u2014
M1030_S0050_G0010_001_a9s=Those machines out in the desert looked just like androids, right?
M1030_S0050_G0020_001_a2b=Right.
M1030_S0050_G0030_001_a9s=But we androids were modeled after our human creators.
M1030_S0050_G0040_001_a9s=So why would machines try to look like us?
M1030_S0050_G0050_001_a2b=......
M1030_S0050_G0060_001_a2b=There's no point trying to work out unsolvable problems.
M1030_S0050_G0070_001_a9s=I suppose...
M1030_S0050_G0071_001_a9s=Looks like our surface route's been cut off.
M1030_S0050_G0072_001_a9s=Maybe we can get through from underground.
M5920_S0010_G0100_001_pod042=Alert.
M5920_S0020_G0100_001_pod153=Alert.
