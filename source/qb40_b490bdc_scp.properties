M6010_S0010_G0090_300_op=I never get tired of looking at Earth...
M6010_S0010_G0100_300_op=The hangar? You can get to it from the elevator to my left.
M6010_S0010_G0110_300_op=I hope we can return to Earth soon, together with mankind...
M6010_S0010_G0120_300_opa=Hello there.
M6010_S0010_G0130_300_opa=You're starting to get quite the reputation.\n...Oh, but don't worry! It's all good!
M6010_S0010_G0140_300_opb=The way you used your black boxes to blow up those Goliaths was so awesome!
M6010_S0010_G0150_300_opa=Er, but try not to ACTUALLY die, okay?
M6010_S0010_G0160_300_opb=We'll take good care of your data, so make sure to upload it frequently.
M6010_S0010_G0170_300_opa=Looking for Command? Just head down the hall to the left.
M6010_S0010_G0180_300_opb=The server administration room is on the right.
M6010_S0010_G0190_300_opa=Take care.
M6010_S0010_G0200_300_opb=See you around!
M6010_S0010_G0840_300_op=Hello!
M6010_S0010_G0850_300_ys=I was just talking about all the plants and animals I saw on Earth. Operators are kind of nuts for data collection, you know!
M6010_S0010_G0860_300_op=It makes me jealous of the combat troops. I'd love to go down there and collect the data myself, but they don't allow it.
M6010_S0010_G0870_300_ys=Hey, I'd take you if I could, but...you know. I don't make the rules.
M6010_S0010_G0880_300_op=I love hearing about Earth, but the most important thing is seeing everyone come back safely.
M6010_S0010_G0890_300_op=And that includes you guys, okay? So be careful!
M6010_S0010_G0900_300_op=Heya! Have you been using your recovery items?
M6010_S0010_G0910_300_op=Everyone on the R&D Team is really proud of them\u2014you can even buy them from the terminals in your quarters. Give 'em a try!
M6010_S0010_G0920_300_op=Hmm? What's that? You'd like to see a greater variety of items for purchase?
M6010_S0010_G0930_300_op=Hey, I get you, but that's just how it is. We're trying to develop more, but for now, what you see is what you get.
M6010_S0010_G1060_300_ysA=Uuurgh... I don't feel so good...
M6010_S0010_G1070_300_ysB=Her balance sensors got damaged, so she gets motion sickness.
M6010_S0010_G1080_300_ysB=No matter how many times I repair the sensors, the problem comes back. It's almost like it's in her head or something...
M6010_S0010_G1090_300_ysB=You guys take care of yourselves so you don't end up like her, all right?
M6010_S0010_G1100_300_ysB=How are you feeling? Ready to get back out there?
M6010_S0010_G1110_300_ysA=N-no... Whole world...still spinny... *urp*
M6010_S0010_G1120_300_ysB=Right-o. I'll make sure to tell Command that you're not fit to use flight units for a while.
M6010_S0010_G1130_300_ysA=Hey there! Are you going down to Earth again?
M6010_S0010_G1140_300_ysB=I'd give almost anything to spend more time in a flight unit...
M6010_S0010_G1150_300_op=We'd all like that! But they're expensive, delicate pieces of equipment, so they don't just hand 'em out willy-nilly.
M6010_S0010_G1160_300_op=And you combat types are the worst! Last time you used a flight unit, it came back with huge scratches on the side!
M6010_S0010_G1170_300_op=Who do you think fixes that, huh? We do! We work our fingers to the bone to get you a beautiful ride, and you go and crap all over it!
M6010_S0010_G1180_300_ysA=All right, all right! I get it! Sheesh...
M6010_S0010_G1190_300_ysB=Flight units are great and all, but why doesn't R&D just install wings and jets right on our bodies?
M6010_S0010_G1200_300_op=That's a GREAT idea! Then you could stop damaging my precious flight units!
M6010_S0010_G1210_300_ysA=Yeah, I asked about that once. They said it would put too much strain on our bodies. Also something about it not being "financially feasible."
M6010_S0010_G1220_300_ysB=Ha! They would say that.
M6010_S0020_G0090_300_op=I wonder what Earth was like when the humans lived there.
M6010_S0020_G0100_300_op=Well, not that I know what it's like on Earth now. But you get what I mean.
M6010_S0020_G0110_300_op=You can get to the hangar from that elevator.
M6010_S0020_G0120_300_op=Oh, you already knew that? Well, excuuuuuse me!
M6010_S0020_G0130_300_opb=Hmmm... What are we going to do?
M6010_S0020_G0140_300_opa=It still hasn't turned up...
M6010_S0020_G0150_300_opa=...What's that? You want to know what's happening?
M6010_S0020_G0160_300_opa=Apparently, one of the units on Earth LOST a Pod in the flooded city.
M6010_S0020_G0170_300_opb=They tried to follow the distress signal, but they still can't find the thing.
M6010_S0020_G0180_300_opa=How do you LOSE a Pod? It staggers the imagination!
M6010_S0020_G0190_300_opb=Anyway, if you happen to find it, will you take care of it? The poor thing is all alone down there.
M6010_S0020_G0200_300_opa=And make sure not to lose it!
M6010_S0020_G0850_300_ys=Wait, I know you. You're the ones who received a peace offer from the machines! So what do you think? Can we trust 'em?
M6010_S0020_G0860_300_ys=We've been fighting those metalheads for so long, it doesn't feel right to suddenly take their word on anything.
M6010_S0020_G0870_300_ys=On the other hand, if this works, Earth would finally be at peace...
M6010_S0020_G0880_300_op=If we reconciled with the machines, then Earth would finally be at peace.
M6010_S0020_G0890_300_op=But it would be a fragile peace at best, so I don't think we'd ever be completely safe.
M6010_S0020_G0900_300_op=Still, if it means our troops can finally lay down their weapons, perhaps it's something we should consider.
M6010_S0020_G0910_300_op=Oh, hello! Have you tried out any of the new products yet?
M6010_S0020_G0920_300_op=They're pretty great, if I do say so myself. \n...And I do!
M6010_S0020_G0930_300_op=If our inventions help prevent even the smallest bit of damage, I'll be happy.
M6010_S0020_G0940_300_op=Creating a new body costs a small fortune, you know?
M6010_S0020_G1080_300_ysA=Uuurgh... I don't feel so good...
M6010_S0020_G1090_300_ysB=Say, you're the one who got the peace offer from the machines, right?
M6010_S0020_G1100_300_ysB=I don't get it. I mean, why now?
M6010_S0020_G1110_300_ysA=If we...make peace...does that mean...I won't have to fly anymore?
M6010_S0020_G1120_300_ysB=Well, not as much as you do now, at least!
M6010_S0020_G1130_300_ysB=How many deaths could have been prevented if we'd just talked to the machines sooner?
M6010_S0020_G1140_300_ysB=I know it's pointless to think about that now, but I just can't shake it.
M6010_S0020_G1150_300_ysB=Say, you're the ones who talked to the machines, right?
M6010_S0020_G1160_300_op=I've always said the only good machine is a dead machine, and I stand by it. I won't ever trust a machine! Ever!
M6010_S0020_G1170_300_op=They're the enemies of humanity! They killed our comrades! And now they're strutting around Earth like they own the joint!
M6010_S0020_G1180_300_ysA=I bet they think we'll accept their terms just to put a stop to this never-ending war.
M6010_S0020_G1190_300_ysB=I wonder where their boss is hiding...
M6010_S0020_G1200_300_ysB=This will all be over once we defeat the aliens. I wish they'd hurry up and show their slimy faces!
M6010_S0020_G1210_300_ysA=We have the upper hand at the moment.
M6010_S0020_G1220_300_ysA=We should just destroy them and bring victory to mankind once and for all!
M6010_S0080_G0000_300_op="This is the Bunker. We've received your report."
M6010_S0080_G0010_300_op="Please continue your hard work."
M6010_S0080_G0020_300_op=Yes? Do you need something?
M6010_S0080_G0030_300_op=How's it going?
M6010_S0080_G0040_300_op=Soooo, I know that rest is important and all, but don't you have an important mission to finish?
M6010_S0080_G0050_300_op=Hey there. Taking a break?
M6010_S0080_G0060_300_op=Well, not my business\u2014but make sure the Commander doesn't catch you! I hear she likes to fire slackers out the airlock.
M6010_S0080_G0450_300_op="This is the Bunker. Please confirm your current status."
M6010_S0080_G0460_300_op="...Understood. I've sent your most recent report to Command and have intel regarding your next mission."
M6010_S0080_G0470_300_op=What happened to you? Were you hurt?
M6010_S0080_G0480_300_op=If so, make sure to take the time to heal up. And be careful out there!
M6010_S0080_G0490_300_op=Taking a break, eh?
M6010_S0080_G0500_300_op=I love slacking off too, but try not to do it too much, okay? ...And if the Commander catches you, we never had this chat!
M6010_S0080_G0540_300_op="This is a message from the Bunker to all Earth-based troops. Flight units are not toys! Please take care of them!"
M6010_S0080_G0550_300_op=Why in the world are you bothering me!? Can't you see how busy I am!?
