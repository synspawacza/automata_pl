M1080_S0090_G0010_201_a9s=......
M1080_S0090_G0020_201_a9s=Those were the words I heard in the moon server.
M1080_S0090_G0030_201_a9s=But why...?
M1080_S0090_G0040_201_pod153=Alert: 2B has defeated the Goliath-class heavy-weapon unit.
M1080_S0090_G0050_201_a9s=Hm? Ah, right.
M1080_S0090_G0060_201_a9s=Okay, good.
M1080_S0090_G0070_201_cmd=9S.
M1080_S0090_G0080_201_a9s=Commander?
M1080_S0090_G0090_201_cmd=I'm sorry. You're needed back at Command.
M1080_S0090_G0100_201_a9s=...Understood.
M1080_S0800_G0000_201_cmd=......
M1080_S0800_G0010_201_cmd=You left quite a trail when you accessed the main server.
M1080_S0800_G0020_201_a9s=That's what I wanted to speak with you about, Commander.
M1080_S0800_G0030_201_cmd=......
M1080_S0800_G0040_201_a9s=I found records stating that the Council of Humanity was established as part of Project YoRHa.
M1080_S0800_G0050_201_a9s=But I'd always heard it was the other way around.
M1080_S0800_G0060_201_a9s=So did YoRHa actually create the Council of Humanity?
M1080_S0800_G0070_201_cmd=......
M1080_S0800_G0080_201_cmd=Yes.
M1080_S0800_G0090_201_cmd=We installed the Council of Humanity's server on the surface of the moon.
M1080_S0800_G0100_201_a9s=But that means...
M1080_S0800_G0110_201_cmd=Mankind no longer exists.
M1080_S0800_G0120_201_a9s=!!
M1080_S0800_G0130_201_cmd=In truth, humans never went to the moon at all.
M1080_S0800_G0140_201_cmd=Any transmissions received from the moon are just dummy signals we set up in advance.
M1080_S0800_G0150_201_cmd=The only thing there is a small bit of data relating to the human genome.
M1080_S0800_G0160_201_a9s=But why would you\u2014
M1080_S0800_G0170_201_cmd=Humans were already extinct when the aliens attacked.
M1080_S0800_G0180_201_cmd=All the details are stored on this memory chip.
M1080_S0800_G0190_201_cmd=If you want to look at it, I won't stop you.
M1080_S0800_G0200_201_a9s=Wait, you're just giving me this? But why?
M1080_S0800_G0210_201_cmd=......
M1080_S0850_H0000_201_cmd=No one fights without a reason.
M1080_S0850_H0010_201_cmd=And we need a god worth dying for.
