M5770_S0010_G0000_001_kj=Oh, you must be with YoRHa. I heard about what happened.
M5770_S0010_G0010_001_kj=I deal in weapons, if you're interested in that type of thing.
M5770_S0010_G0020_001_a9s=What kind of weapons?
M5770_S0010_G0030_001_kj=Basically, I rebuild and repair relics from the old world.
M5770_S0010_G0040_001_kj=Although to be honest, my tools are in pretty sad shape at the moment.
M5770_S0010_G0050_001_kj=But if I can get the servicing device in that toolbox up and running, I could start fixing and selling weapons again. Take a look at it, will you?
M5770_S0010_G0060_001_a9s=That looks busted, all right.
M5770_S0010_G0070_001_kj=You know it! And as I bet you can tell, I'm no good at that sort of delicate repair.
M5770_S0010_G0080_001_sele=Help him out.
M5770_S0010_G0090_001_sele=Leave him to his own devices.
M5770_S0010_G0100_001_kj=If I can't get that servicing device repaired, I won't be long for this line of work...
M5770_S0010_G0110_001_kj=You mean it? That'd be a huge help!
M5770_S0010_G0119_001_a9s=Looks like the servicing device shorted out. Must have put too much load on it.
M5770_S0010_G0120_001_a9s=I'm thinking four complex gadgets will be enough to fix it.
M5770_S0010_G0130_001_a9s=Any idea where I'd find complex gadgets?
M5770_S0010_G0140_001_kj=Folks say you can find 'em over in the city ruins\u2014although I also hear the place is crawling with incredibly aggressive machines.
M5770_S0020_G0000_001_a9s=This is the place that weapons trader was talking about...
M5770_S0020_G0010_001_a9s=Uh oh. I'm picking up hostile machine lifeforms.
M5770_S0020_G0020_001_pod042=Hostile machine lifeforms destroyed.
M5770_S0020_G0030_001_a9s=Whew! That was a slog and a half.
M5770_S0020_G0040_001_a9s=Let's see if we can find any of those complex gadgets the weapons trader was after.
M5770_S0020_G0050_001_a9s=That should be enough. Let's get these back to the trader.
M5770_S0030_G0000_001_a9s=I think this should be enough to fix your broken device.
M5770_S0030_G0010_001_kj=Well, how do you like that? Looks like I'm back in business!
M5770_S0030_G0020_001_a9s=Good to hear.
M5770_S0030_G0030_001_kj=You know it! I make these weapons to keep my friends safe, after all.
M5770_S0030_G0040_001_kj=Although sometimes I wonder...
M5770_S0030_G0050_001_kj=What if my weapons are just making my friends die all the faster?
M5770_S0030_G0060_001_a2b=......
M5770_S0030_G0070_001_kj=Ah, never mind. Forget I said anything.
M5770_S0030_G0080_001_kj=Anyway, come back in a little while, all right? I should have some new gear for you then.
M5770_S0030_G0090_001_kj=Hey, it's you!
M5770_S0030_G0091_200_robocreator=Oh, I almost forgot. I still owe you a reward.
M5770_S0030_G0100_001_kj=I wanted to say thanks for helping me get things up and running again, so I whipped you up some upgrade materials.
M5770_S0030_G0101_300_robocreator=Wanna try 'em out?
M5770_S0030_G0102_300_sele=You bet!
M5770_S0030_G0103_300_sele=Not this time.
M5770_S0030_G0104_300_robocreator=Come to me whenever you need help with your weapons.
M5770_S0030_G0110_001_a9s=Hey, so you craft new weapons from older models, right? But where do the older models come from?
M5770_S0030_G0111_001_a2b=Hey, so where do you get these older weapon models from?
M5770_S0030_G0112_001_a2=So where do all these older weapon models come from, huh?
M5770_S0030_G0120_001_kj=Oh, the lady who owns the place sends 'em over every once in a while.
M5770_S0030_G0130_001_kj=Her name's Accord, and she's the proprietor of this here business. I just tend to customers and keep all the repair devices humming.
M5770_S0030_G0140_001_kj=I only see her every few years, to be honest. She mostly just uses delivery drones to drop things off.
M5770_S0030_G0150_001_kj=I don't know where she gets this stuff, but most of it's in pretty good condition!
M5770_S0030_G0160_001_kj=Say, if you ever happen to run into her, say hello from me, all right?
M6090_S0030_G0011_300_kj=You can upgrade the weapons you buy here.
M6090_S0030_G0012_300_kj=How much I can upgrade your weapons depends on how much money and materials you have. Some upgraded weapons also add effects that improve performance.
M6090_S0030_G0013_300_kj=Give it a try if you like.
M6090_S0030_G0041_300_kj=Right-o! This weapon is now Level 3.
M6090_S0030_G0042_300_kj=That's as far as we can take it here, but there are craftsmen in the world who can raise it to Level 4.
M6090_S0030_G0043_300_kj=If I ever met someone like that, I'd want them to teach me all they knew!
