CHAPTER_HELP_01_00=2B and 9S have been ordered to gain intel and destroy a Goliath-class weapon. They find their target and engage in combat, but 9S ends up getting wounded trying to protect 2B.
CHAPTER_HELP_02_00=2B and 9S have to gain intel from the Resistance at the city ruins. When they arrive at the camp, they find many androids who need their help.
CHAPTER_HELP_03_00=While heading to the desert area, 2B and 9S run into machines that can talk. Chasing after them, they find a machine lifeform that looks exactly like an android...
CHAPTER_HELP_04_00=2B and 9S head to the amusement park, where they are welcomed by strangely dressed machines. They also have an audience with an aspiring opera singer.
CHAPTER_HELP_05_00=A large hole has opened up in the city ruins, and 2B and 9S travel down it to find the alien mothership. Inside, they run into Adam and Eve.
CHAPTER_HELP_06_00=2B and 9S head to the forest kingdom. As soon as they find the king, he is destroyed by a mysterious female android. Her name is A2 and she is a deserter.
CHAPTER_HELP_07_00=The aircraft carrier is under attack, so 2B and 9S head there to offer support. Once they arrive, a huge machine lifeform appears out of the depths of the ocean.
CHAPTER_HELP_08_00=9S has disappeared after the destruction of the giant machine. 2B sets out to find him and ends up in a mysterious white city where Adam is waiting for her.
CHAPTER_HELP_09_00=2B and Pascal head to the abandoned factory to  negotiate peace with a group of machines. They find a religious cult that soon  turns out to be hostile.
CHAPTER_HELP_10_00=The city ruins are overrun with machines, so 2B and 9S head there to support the Resistance. One particularly large weapon turns out to contain a very angry Eve.
CHAPTER_HELP_11_00=Having destroyed Adam and Eve, the YoRHa turn their attention to the other machines. However, they are wiped out by a large-scale virus, which has now spread to 2B as well...
CHAPTER_HELP_12_00=Pod 042 received 2B's final order to support A2, and stuck fast to her through her travels - whether A2 liked it or not.
CHAPTER_HELP_13_00=Having accessed the Tower, 9S was compelled to head for the Resource Recovery Unit. This led him towards the massive unit near the forest castle.
CHAPTER_HELP_14_00=The machines of Pascal's village suddenly went haywire. A2 rushed to the village to help Pascal and the children escape, but they find no safe harbor. A2 fights beside Pascal, but...
CHAPTER_HELP_15_00=9S's next target is the Resource Recovery Unit in the Flooded City. Through deft hacking, he obtains the second Tower access key, but his body is left unable to fight.
CHAPTER_HELP_16_00=9S fights the corrupted Operator 210 inside the recovery unit and again encounters A2. As soon as he turns his ire upon her, a machine lifeform crashes their reunion.
CHAPTER_HELP_17_00=9S and A2 are guided into the Tower, unaware of the purpose for which it was built by machine lifeforms. A truth awaits them inside, as hideous as the Red Girl's nightmare.
CHAPTER_HELP_01_01_0=The YoRHa commence paratrooper operations, divided into aerial strike units with scanner models for support. Their mission is to locate and destroy colossal weaponry.
CHAPTER_HELP_01_01_1=YoRHa paratroopers enter the atmosphere from orbit. While leading the aerial units towards the abandoned factory, 2B's comrades begin steadily dropping like flies...
CHAPTER_HELP_01_01_2=On the ground, 9S is assigned to support the YoRHa by disabling the defense system at the enemy base. He boards an aerial unit to make contact with the enemy defenses.
CHAPTER_HELP_01_02_0=2B and 9S are reunited before splitting up to search the factory.
CHAPTER_HELP_01_02_1=2B lands at the abandoned factory, where a gigantic defensive weapon resembling heavy machinery lies in wait.
CHAPTER_HELP_01_02_2=9S destroys the giant weapon attacking 2B and appears before her. He's investigating the factory exterior with the flight unit.
CHAPTER_HELP_01_02_3=2B heads into the factory in search of colossal weaponry.
CHAPTER_HELP_01_02_4=2B searched through the factory but failed to find her objective. Just as she was about to give up, it found her\u2014two colossal weapons attack.
CHAPTER_HELP_01_03_0=It looked as if 2B had defeated her attackers. However, they reactivate and combine with the factory itself to reveal their true form.
CHAPTER_HELP_01_03_1=2B takes on the colossal weaponry over the bridge. The fight proves a struggle due to their overwhelming difference in size.
CHAPTER_HELP_01_03_2=To support 2B, 9S tries to hack her foe's nervous system. Though heavily wounded in the attempt to protect 2B, he is able to take control of the machine's upper arm with his Pod.
CHAPTER_HELP_01_03_3=2B receives the flight unit from 9S and uses it to mount an aerial assault on the colossal weaponry.
CHAPTER_HELP_01_04_0=2B and 9S used the black box to destroy the enemy herd. Their bodies were also lost in the blast, but their data was loaded into new bodies, allowing them to be reactivated.
CHAPTER_HELP_01_04_1=2B wakes up in the YoRHa forces' satellite station in the bunker.
CHAPTER_HELP_01_04_2=9S heads to 2B's room to help with her reboot setup process.
CHAPTER_HELP_01_05_0=In the command room, the YoRHa commander gives the order to make contact with and gather information on the Resistance on the ground.
CHAPTER_HELP_02_01_0=2B and crew fly from the bunker to the City Ruins. Landing at the Resistance Camp, they soon make contact with the Resistance leader, Anemone.
CHAPTER_HELP_02_02_0=2B's crew leaves the Resistance Camp behind to pursue and take down machine lifeforms in the desert.
CHAPTER_HELP_03_01_0=2B and 9S enter the desert in pursuit of machine lifeforms. However, oddly, the machines they encounter are capable of speech and wear clothing.
CHAPTER_HELP_03_02_0=An uncountable number of android corpses were left abandoned in the ruins of what had once been an apartment complex.
CHAPTER_HELP_03_03_0=A group of erratically-moving machine lifeforms form up together to make a cocoon, from which one boy is born\u2014a machine lifeform bearing a strong resemblance to androids.
CHAPTER_HELP_03_04_0=2B and crew stave off the humanoid machine and escape from the collapsing grotto. They then receive a transmission from the Bunker with orders to search for a missing YoRHa party.
CHAPTER_HELP_04_01_0=The allied signal originated from the disquieting ruins of an amusement park. There, machine lifeforms dressed up as clowns sing and dance merrily.
CHAPTER_HELP_04_02_0=In the amusement park square, 2B and crew were welcomed by a machine lifeform in the form of an old-world tank.
CHAPTER_HELP_04_03_0=2B and 9S drop into a theatre where they expect to find their allies. The curtain rises in the darkness to reveal a fearsome machine, wrapped in android bodies... who begins to sing.
CHAPTER_HELP_04_04_0=A machine lifeform bearing a white flag awaited 2B and crew at the entrance to the amusement park ruins.
CHAPTER_HELP_05_01_0=Invited along by a friendly-looking machine lifeform, 2B and crew come into contact with an individual calling himself "Pascal."
CHAPTER_HELP_05_02_0=Upon leaving Pascal's village, 2B and her allies receive a report of a giant machine lifeform in the city ruins. They take a flight unit over to intercept it.
CHAPTER_HELP_05_03_0=The city ruins have been greatly altered by an underground collapse. Following an alien signal, 2B and crew head down and find what appears to be an alien mothership.
CHAPTER_HELP_05_04_0=Inside the ship, 2B and crew are shocked to find a desiccated alien corpse. Then, before their eyes, appear two machines born in the desert cave: Adam and Eve.
CHAPTER_HELP_06_01_0=2B and 9S return to the bunker, after Adam and Eve escape. They report to the commander that the aliens had been killed years ago by the machines.
CHAPTER_HELP_06_02_0=2B and crew are ordered to gather intelligence on machine lifeforms. According to Pascal, off-network machines have established a nation in the depths of the woods.
CHAPTER_HELP_06_03_0=2B and 9S pass through the shopping center and into the forest. There, they're attacked by armored machine lifeforms, calling out in unison for their "King."
CHAPTER_HELP_06_04_0=2B and 9S arrive at the castle in the woods. Fighting off enemy machine lifeforms, they make their way into the castle to investigate it.
CHAPTER_HELP_06_05_0=Finally arriving in the throne room, 2B and 9S find that the King is an infant machine lifeform. Then, a mysterious android suddenly appears before them.
CHAPTER_HELP_07_01_0=9S reports on A2, the android they met in the forest castle, to Pascal. Pascal also has records of A2, but they don't offer much information beyond that she is dangerous.
CHAPTER_HELP_07_02_0=2B and 9S return to the Resistance camp to check their data and refuel. Under request from Anemone, they then head to the Flooded City to protect the android army carrier.
CHAPTER_HELP_07_03_0=Receiving word that the seaward carrier is under attack, they requisition flight units and repel the enemy forces.
CHAPTER_HELP_07_04_0=A machine larger than any 2B has ever seen appears from the depths of the ocean. Held off by a powerful electromagnetic field, they try to fight back with an interception mortar.
CHAPTER_HELP_08_01_0=The huge machine lifeform has been destroyed. However, 9S was lost in the explosion. 2B scrambles to search for him.
CHAPTER_HELP_08_01_1=Waking up, 2B sets out to find the missing 9S. She receives information about a particular scanner from Anemone, to detect his faint black box signal.
CHAPTER_HELP_08_01_2=Following 9S's signal, 2B reaches a white crystal city. Adam appears; he built the city out of an interest in humanity. He challenges 2B to fight so that he might understand death.
CHAPTER_HELP_08_01_3=9S, broken down by the shockwave from the destruction of the machine lifeform, wanders among his own memory banks.
CHAPTER_HELP_09_01_0=2B and Pascal are taken into the abandoned factory for peace negotiations, but they're attacked by machines straight away. Meanwhile, 9S verifies his own systems in the Bunker.
CHAPTER_HELP_09_01_1=9S wonders if he may have been infected with a virus while held captive by Adam. He performs an extensive verification of his own systems for a possible data overhaul.
CHAPTER_HELP_09_01_2=2B is tasked with looking into the movements of machines released from the network. She contacts Pascal, who tells her that another machine group has offered a peace treaty.
CHAPTER_HELP_09_01_3=2B meets Pascal at the factory ruin entrance to negotiate peace with the group of machines. They find a strange cult of religious robots waiting for them inside the factory.
CHAPTER_HELP_09_02_0=9S hacks from the Bunker to aid 2B and Pascal's escape.
CHAPTER_HELP_09_02_1=Waking up in his quarters at the Bunker, 9S hears from the Operator that 2B has requested support. To help 2B, 9S hacks into the abandoned factory from the large terminal.
CHAPTER_HELP_09_02_2=2B and Pascal mange to escape the abandoned factory, thanks to 9S's help.
CHAPTER_HELP_09_02_3=2B encounters a large, many-legged weapon while escaping. Attacks can't penetrate its powerful energy shield. 9S hacks into the factory system to disable the shield.
CHAPTER_HELP_09_03_0=9S stops hacking after confirming the destruction of the weapon. However, he learned a dangerous truth in the process...
CHAPTER_HELP_09_03_1=The large, multi-legged weapon defeated, 2B rides the elevator back to the surface with Pascal.
CHAPTER_HELP_09_03_2=9S is called by the commander, and reports the incoherent data he discovered in the main server.  The commander tells the trembling 9S the truth: Humanity is truly extinct.
CHAPTER_HELP_10_01_0=9S takes his flight unit from his battle station and takes off from the Bunker. 2B, on the ground, goes to save the Resistance from a berserk machine lifeform.
CHAPTER_HELP_10_01_1=9S is disturbed by the extinction of mankind. He gets an urgent order to his battle station, as if to drown out his troubled thoughts.
CHAPTER_HELP_10_01_2=2B has safely escaped the abandoned factory with Pascal, when calls for rescue from Anemone at the Resistance camp come pouring in.
CHAPTER_HELP_10_01_3=2B arrives at the Resistance camp to find a machine preying on the androids there. The machine has a shield that repels projectiles, so 2B must destroy it with close-range attacks.
CHAPTER_HELP_10_01_4=Waiting in the City Ruins was a large multi-legged weapon that attacks with electrical discharges.
CHAPTER_HELP_10_02_0=9S flies in during the fight with the multi-legged weapon, dropping from his flight unit for a direct attack. The weapon is silenced, but from its husk appears Eve.
CHAPTER_HELP_10_03_0=2B and 9S hurry to Pascal's village after receiving a distress signal from Pascal. Berserk machine lifeforms have invaded the village.
CHAPTER_HELP_10_04_0=Eve, driven wild with hate after losing Adam, has made the machine lifeforms on the network savage. 2B and 9S go into battle with Eve to destroy him and end the machine rampage.
CHAPTER_HELP_10_05_0=9S is physically infected when Eve is separated from the network. 2B decides to put the infected 9S out of his misery with her own hands...
CHAPTER_HELP_10_05_1=The end to the battle over Adam and Eve approaches. As the war between androids and machines continues around them, 2B and 9S cling tightly to life.
CHAPTER_HELP_10_05_2=2B returns to the Bunker with 9S. Dressed in armor, she sets out to plunge herself into a new battle...
CHAPTER_HELP_11_01_0=With Adam and Eve, the backbone of the network, gone and the machines' chain of command thrown into chaos, the android army proceeds with their large-scale ground invasion.
CHAPTER_HELP_11_02_0=To cripple the machines' aerial defense system, 9S hacks into it along with the scanner squad.
CHAPTER_HELP_11_03_0=2B and 9S, acting as a guerilla force, assist the front line troops in claiming each territory.
CHAPTER_HELP_11_04_0=Triggered by an enemy EMP attack, YoRHa units are corroded by the virus. 2B and 9S are forced to turn their weapons on their own comrades to survive.
CHAPTER_HELP_11_05_0=2B wakes in her quarters in the Bunker. She reported the situation to the commander with 9S, but the Bunker was already infected, and the commander would share its fate.
CHAPTER_HELP_11_06_0=2B escapes the Bunker, but she's knocked out of the air by attacking YoRHa. While fighting off pursuing machines, she notices that her own body is being eaten away by the virus.
CHAPTER_HELP_11_07_0=9S lands on the ground and heads towards 2B, relying on her black box signal. There, he sees A2 - and 2B, on her last legs.
CHAPTER_HELP_12_01_0=A2 wakes up in the shopping center ruins. She heads to the desert to destroy a large machine, resenting the Pod clinging to her all the while.
CHAPTER_HELP_12_02_0=A2 destroys the machine in the desert, but is disheartened when a colossal, interlocking machine appears from the sand. Struggling, she goes into B Mode to fight it.
CHAPTER_HELP_13_01_0=9S is knocked unconscious by the collapsing landform. He wakes up in the care of Devola and Popola in the Resistance camp.
CHAPTER_HELP_13_02_0=9S heads towards the massive structure that appeared in the City Ruins. Accessing the system, he's greeted by a voice introducing a tour to the Resource Recovery Unit.
CHAPTER_HELP_13_03_0=While going from the tower to the Resource Recovery Unit, 9S decisively makes up his mind to destroy machine lifeforms and kill A2.
CHAPTER_HELP_13_04_0=9S arrives at the bottom of the Resource Recovery Unit at last. He boards the defended Recovery Unit and sets off for the upper levels to get the Access Release Key.
CHAPTER_HELP_14_01_0=A2, having suffered an overload during the battle with the machine, reboots. She goes to the Resistance camp to change her fuel filter, and Anemone refers her to Pascal.
CHAPTER_HELP_14_02_0=Pascal spent uneventful days tending to the children... Until suddenly, a strange sound blared out from afar, threatening to shatter his peaceful life.
CHAPTER_HELP_14_03_0=A2, having gathered the materials Pascal requested, was just about to return to the village when she received an alarming message from Pascal.
CHAPTER_HELP_14_04_0=A2 arrives back at Pascal's village to find a group of cannibal machine lifeforms.
CHAPTER_HELP_14_05_0=Pascal and the children escape to the abandoned factory. A2 goes, learns of a large group of enemies and moves to intercept them. But something far worse awaits her after the fight.
CHAPTER_HELP_15_01_0=9S's Pod warns him of irregularities in his vitals, but he continues hurrying to the next Resource Recovery Unit without paying it any heed.
CHAPTER_HELP_15_02_0=9S boards the Resource Recovery Unit in the Flooded City. He isn't able to confirm any enemies inside it. This unit's system protections must be hacked to reach to core.
CHAPTER_HELP_15_03_0=9S's NFCS is malfunctioning, and 9S cannot operate at full capacity in combat. He aims for the Resistance camp, in order to have it repaired by Devola.
CHAPTER_HELP_15_04_0=9S arrives at the Resistance camp at last. Devola and her friends have been worried about him \u2014 but their words don't reach him.
CHAPTER_HELP_16_01_1=After being repaired, 9S heads towards the next Resource Recovery Unit. This leads him to the amusement park.
CHAPTER_HELP_16_01_2=A2 leaves the abandoned factory and goes outside, where the sky rings with the Tower system's voice guidance system. Guided by the voice, she heads towards the giant unit in the east.
CHAPTER_HELP_16_02_0=Inside the Recovery Unit, 9S is barraged by long-distance attacks from machine lifeforms. Destroying them, he presses on until he meets the last person he expected to see...
CHAPTER_HELP_16_03_0=Operator 210, wounded by 9S, is finished off by A2. 9S turns his fury onto A2 when a new foe appears below, and he descends, leaving A2 to fight the new enemy machine's brothers.
CHAPTER_HELP_17_01_0=9S is awakened by his Pod. He has all authentication keys, and heads for the Tower entrance. He unlocks it to find a huge number of enemies; Devola and Popola appear just in time.
CHAPTER_HELP_17_02_0=Thanks to Devola and Popola's backup, 9S finally enters the Tower, which has some entertainment prepared. The worst thing 9S could imagine: A group of 2B-type androids.
CHAPTER_HELP_17_03_0=A2 leaves the Recovery Unit in the amusement park. Hearing from her Pod that the Tower gate is open, she makes her way to the entrance.
CHAPTER_HELP_17_04_0=A2 sneaks into the Tower. While searching its interior, she steps into a gigantic, white library.
CHAPTER_HELP_17_05_0=Having lost his left arm, 9S grafts one from a 2B copy. The arm is infected, and he must hack himself to remove the virus. As he fights, a group of girls in red clothes appear.
CHAPTER_HELP_17_06_0=A2 fights off the multi-leg weapon in the library. She boards the elevator to the top of the Tower when she's forcibly hacked. In cyberspace, girls in red clothes challenge her.
CHAPTER_HELP_17_07_0=9S commandeers a flight unit from the infected YoRHa and heads to the top of the Tower. A2 fights the large multi-leg weapon in the ascending elevator.
CHAPTER_HELP_17_08_0=9S and A2 reach the top of the Tower. Two large multi-leg weapons form into one and stand against them.
CHAPTER_HELP_17_09_0=The machine defeated, 9S and A2 turn on each other. A2 explains it's pointless to kill each other, but 9S is deafened by hate. Thus begins the final battle between the last YoRHa.
CHAPTER_HELP_17_10_0=9S and A2 both greet their final moments.
CHAPTER_HELP_17_10_1=9S attacks, and A2 counter-attacks. A2 hears 2B's voice in the back of her mind, and lowers her guard for just a moment. Run through, she stabs 9S with her sword as she falls...
CHAPTER_HELP_17_10_2=Having felled 9S, A2 enters his system internals to eliminate the viral corruption.
CHAPTER_HELP_17_11_0=Black box responses cease from all YoRHa units. The Pods move the YoRHa Project into its final phase.
