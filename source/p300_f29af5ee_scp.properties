M3020_S0026_G0000_001_a9s=Hey, Pod.
M3020_S0026_G0010_001_a9s=Give me a rundown on what happened while I was resting.
M3020_S0026_G0020_001_pod153=Affirmative. Relevant data concerns the massive facility you just accessed.
M3020_S0026_G0030_001_pod153=It appears to be machine-related in origin, though further details are unknown.
M3020_S0026_G0040_001_pod153=Additionally, the large structural units launched from the facility have been detected in multiple areas.
M3020_S0026_G0050_001_a9s=Large structural units?
M3020_S0026_G0060_001_pod153=Said units were marked as goals earlier. They are believed to be so-called "resource-recovery units".
M3020_S0026_G0070_001_a9s=What do these units do?
M3020_S0026_G0080_001_pod153=Unknown.
M3020_S0026_G0090_001_a9s=Where's A2?
M3020_S0026_G0100_001_pod153=Unit A2's position and current status are unknown.
M3020_S0026_G0110_001_a9s=All right.
M3020_S0026_G0120_001_a9s=Mark the positions of those units on my map, will you?
M3020_S0026_G0130_001_pod153=Proposal: Unit 9S should state his intentions.
M3020_S0026_G0140_001_a9s=I'm going to wipe out the machines.
M3020_S0026_G0150_001_pod153=With the Bunker destroyed, previous orders to YoRHa units would be suspended.
M3020_S0026_G0160_001_pod153=Proposal: Rendezvous with Resistance forces and confirm chain of command.
M3020_S0026_G0170_001_a9s=I don't care about chain of command.
M3020_S0026_G0180_001_a9s=I have one goal now.
M3020_S0026_G0190_001_a9s=I'm going to kill every last machine.
M3020_S0026_G0200_001_a9s=And then...
M3020_S0026_G0210_001_a9s=I'm going to kill A2.
M3020_S0026_G0220_300_pod153=Proposal: Investigate the marked resource recovery units.
M3020_S0026_G0230_300_a9s=I know.
M3020_S0040_G0000_001_a9s=Is that one of our large units?
M3020_S0040_G0010_001_pod153=Affirmative.
M3020_S0040_G0020_001_pod153=Said unit appears to be delivering something to the giant facility.
M3020_S0040_G0030_001_pod153=Hypothesis: This facility may be designed to transport some kind of resource.
M3020_S0040_G0040_001_a9s=What's the resource it's transporting?
M3020_S0040_G0050_001_pod153=Unknown.
M3020_S0040_G0060_001_a9s=For what purpose?
M3020_S0040_G0070_001_pod153=Unknown.
M5920_S0130_G0000_001_a9s=Huh? Fog?
M5920_S0130_G0010_001_pod153=Analysis: The fog is actually steam emitted by a large enemy structural unit.
M5920_S0130_G0020_001_a9s=Steam? For what purpose?
M5920_S0130_G0030_001_pod153=Unknown.
