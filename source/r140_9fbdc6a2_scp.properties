M5040_S0010_G0000_300_papa=My son told me how you helped him. Thank you.
M5040_S0010_G0010_300_papa=I fear this is in no small part my fault, for I put all the burden of raising him on my wife.
M5040_S0010_G0020_300_papa=You certainly did!
M5040_S0010_G0030_300_papa=I'm sorry, dear.
M5040_S0010_G0040_300_papa=Yeah, Daddy! You should play with me more!
M5040_S0010_G0050_300_papa=I'm sorry...
M5040_S0010_G0060_300_papa=Well, as long as you've learned your lesson...
M5040_S0010_G0070_300_papa=Yeah! Learned your lesson!
M5040_S0010_G0080_300_papa=I was hoping one of you would take my side...
M5040_S0010_G0090_300_papa=I suppose I should try to be more of a "family man," as they say.
M5040_S0010_G0100_300_papa=But what does that entail, exactly...?
M5040_S0010_G0110_300_papa=Thank you for saving my son.
M5040_S0010_G0120_300_papa=I feel like I understand him better than before.
M5040_S0010_G0130_300_papa=I know that raising a child is never easy, but I feel it's worth the struggle.
M5040_S0010_G0140_300_child=Hey! Thanks for before!
M5040_S0010_G0150_300_child=I'm a really good boy now. I listen to EVERYTHING Mommy says!
M5040_S0010_G0160_300_child=Really!
M5040_S0010_G0170_300_child=I'm good now! I'm really, REALLY good!
M5040_S0010_G0180_300_child=Really! I mean it!
