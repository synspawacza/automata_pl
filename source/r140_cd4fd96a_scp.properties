M1040_S0030_G0020_001_n02=Stop! Do not kill!
M1040_S0030_G0030_001_n02=No fighting! No fighting!
M1040_S0030_G0040_001_n02=Don't kill! Don't kill!
M1040_S0030_G0050_001_n02=We have done nothing bad!
M1040_S0030_G0060_001_n02=I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
M3060_S0036_G0050_001_a9s=......
M5110_S0010_G0005_300_sister=I heard my sister was...found in the desert.
M5110_S0010_G0006_300_sister=I can't believe she's no longer functioning while I'm still here...
M5221_S0000_G0020_300_robochild=This is sooo fuuuun!
M5221_S0030_G0130_001_robochild=It's a thank-you present!
M5250_S0010_G0360_001_robostrange=......
M5520_S0020_G0030_001_pascal=Superb! Thank you for this valuable information.
M5520_S0020_G0040_001_pascal=Please take this as a reward.
M5802_S0010_G0230_001_robomother=Will you listen to my darling boy? He has a goal now! How wonderful!
M5802_S0010_G0240_001_robomother=And it's all thanks to you!
M5803_S0010_G0010_001_robomother=Rrrrgh! What am I supposed to DO!?
M6050_S0010_G0230_300_villager=Ah, <SARU_JAN>...
M6050_S0010_G0550_300_villager=There is no meaning in war.
M6050_S0010_G0560_300_villager=<SARU_JAN>'s right.
M6050_S0010_G1840_300_villager=Hello. Nothing to report from the village today.
M6050_S0010_G1850_300_villager=You can relax here for as long as you like.
M6050_S0010_G1860_300_villager=Nothing much happens here, but that's what makes us so special!
M6050_S0010_G1870_300_villager=Wander around. See the sights. It'll do you good.
M6050_S0010_G1880_300_kj=Anything here catch your eye?
M6050_S0010_G1890_300_kj=I'm going to go see the guy in the forest soon.
M6050_S0010_G1900_300_kj=He taught me how to make things, and I can vouch for his talent.
M6050_S0010_G1910_300_kj=Come see me again.
M6050_S0010_G1920_300_ps=Look around as much as you like.
M6050_S0010_G1930_300_ps=Come again!
M6050_S0010_G1950_300_villager=When I woke up this morning, I'd lost another torso.
M6050_S0010_G1960_300_villager=That guy found one just lying around, so I should probably go see what I can find.
M6050_S0010_G1970_300_villager=You have no idea how tough it is having to search for body parts.
M6050_S0010_G1980_300_villager=Look, look! I found another torso for my body!
M6050_S0010_G1990_300_villager=It was right outside the village!
M6050_S0010_G2000_300_villager=Can you believe it!?
M6050_S0010_G2010_300_villager=I just need one more and I'll have my triple-belly!
M6050_S0010_G2020_300_villager=I haven't seen any forest animals recently.
M6050_S0010_G2030_300_villager=I hope they're doing okay.
M6050_S0010_G2040_300_villager=You and I, we have the same smell about us.
M6050_S0010_G2050_300_villager=And no, I don't mean the smell of machine oil.
M6050_S0010_G2060_300_villager=You're the only one who keeps visiting me here. You sure are an odd one.
M6050_S0010_G2070_300_villager=There's nothing to do here, although I can provide casual conversation if required.
M6050_S0010_G2080_300_pascal=I saw a huge explosion far off in the sky.
M6050_S0010_G2090_300_pascal=Forgive my intrusion, but...was it something connected with you?
M6050_S0010_G2100_300_pascal=I realize this village could never replace your home, but please know that you are always welcome here.
M6050_S0010_G2110_300_pascal=Please make yourself at home.
M6050_S0010_G2120_300_villager=Heya! How ya been?
M6050_S0010_G2130_300_villager=I've been fine. I'm always fine!
M6050_S0010_G2140_300_villager=So do you wanna play with us?
M6050_S0010_G2150_300_villager=Uncle Pascal always says your health is more important than anything!
M6050_S0010_G2160_300_villager=You wanna play with us? It'll be healthy!
M6050_S0010_G2170_300_villager=I decided to play with the rest of the kids after all.
M6050_S0010_G2180_300_villager=They kept begging me to, so I had to oblige, ya know?
M6050_S0010_G2190_300_villager=So what should we play today? Tag or hide-and-seek? I'm up for either!
M6050_S0010_G2240_300_villager=I'm getting tired of looking at the same view every day.
M6050_S0010_G2250_300_villager=Maybe I'll go for a walk. It's been a while since I last went outside.
M6050_S0010_G2260_300_villager=All I do is fly through the sky all day. Sometimes I just want to try something else.
M6050_S0010_G2270_300_villager=I've been thinking about maybe getting a house.
M6050_S0010_G2280_300_villager=I saw the sky go super bright!
M6050_S0010_G2290_300_villager=I bet it was one of them shooting star thingies. I should make a wish!
M6050_S0010_G2300_300_villager=Okay! Sooo...I wish to live happily with everyone in the village for ever and ever!
M6050_S0010_G2420_300_villager=I'm not done playing yet!
M6050_S0010_G2430_300_villager=So what should we play next?
M6050_S0010_G2440_300_villager=Let's play red light, green light!
M6050_S0010_G2450_300_villager=Even with a body this big, there are still ways for me to help people.
M6050_S0010_G2460_300_villager=If I must, I'll even fight to protect my fellow villagers.
M6050_S0010_G2470_300_villager=My neck hurts from looking up all the time.
M6050_S0010_G2480_300_villager=And I don't even know where my neck is!
M6050_S0010_G2490_300_villager=The world's too small for me.
M6050_S0010_G2500_300_villager=And my neck's tired from looking up all the time!
M6050_S0010_G2600_300_papa=This is bad. This is really bad...
M6050_S0010_G2930_300_villager=Welcome to our village!
M6050_S0010_G2960_300_villager=Hello. Nice day we're having!
M6050_S0010_G2970_300_villager=Let me know if I can help you with anything.
M6050_S0010_G3100_300_villager=I was having so much fun being carried around, I think it made my friend angry. Since I don't have arms myself, I never really thought about how I might be putting him out.
M6050_S0010_G3110_300_villager=We're friends again, but I wonder if he'd be willing to carry me more if I gave him some oil for his arms...
M6050_S0010_G3120_300_villager=It's no fun playing on your own.
M6050_S0010_G3130_300_villager=That's why I made up with my friend. We agreed I only have to carry him three times a day.
