M1030_S0400_G0000_001_a2b=We have to save those androids.
M1030_S0400_G0001_001_a2b=Thanks for the assist.
M1030_S0400_G0002_001_a9s=Oh, you mean the hacking? No worries.
M1030_S0400_G0003_001_a9s=Us scanners are pretty good at that kind of thing.
M1030_S0400_G0004_001_a9s=I've got your back anytime.
M1030_S0400_G0010_001_a9s=I'm sorry, 2B. Their circuits are fried.
M1030_S0400_G0020_001_a9s=I think they were only being kept alive by that enemy.
M1030_S0400_G0030_001_a2b=...Oh.
M1030_S0400_G0040_001_a9s=So, um...
M1030_S0400_G0050_001_a2b=What is it?
M1030_S0400_G0060_001_a9s=That machine had some pretty weird things to say, huh?
M1030_S0400_G0070_001_a9s=It's almost like it had actual emotion\u2014
M1030_S0400_G0080_001_a2b=The machines don't have feelings.
M1030_S0400_G0090_001_a2b=You said that yourself.
M1030_S0400_G0100_001_a9s=Yeah, I...I guess.
M1030_S0400_G0110_001_a2b=Hostiles!
M1030_S0400_G0120_001_n02=I am not hostile.
M1030_S0400_G0130_001_a9s=Huh?
M1030_S0400_G0140_001_n02=You defeated broken machine. You saved us.
M1030_S0400_G0150_001_a9s=This thing is awfully verbose for a machine.
M1030_S0400_G0160_001_n02=We repay you. Come to our village.
M1030_S0400_G0170_001_sele=Go to the village.
M1030_S0400_G0180_001_sele=Don't go to the village.
M1030_S0400_G0190_001_a9s=It could be a trap...
M1030_S0400_G0200_001_a9s=Still, we should at least head over there and gather data, right?
M1030_S0400_G0210_001_a9s=It does seem awfully suspicious...
M1030_S0400_G0220_001_a9s=But I've never seen a machine that could communicate at this level.
M1030_S0400_G0230_001_a9s=It might be worth checking out.
M1030_S0400_G0240_001_n02=We do not want fight.
