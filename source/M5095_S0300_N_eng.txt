My name is Plato 1728.<bt_wait>
I am the 1728th combat weapon.<bt_wait>
I'm a defective product and a general failure.<bt_wait>

Everyone made fun of me.<bt_wait>
Nobody wanted to be friends with me.<bt_wait>

One day, I found a small friend in an abandoned factory.<bt_wait>
It was a small doll that humans had left behind.<bt_wait>
It couldn't speak, but I decided to take care of it.<bt_wait>

Every day, I would go and talk to it.
And every day, the war grew worse and worse.<bt_wait>

In the end,<bt_wait> the factory <bt_wait>got blown to pieces.

<page>
I saw my friend be consumed by fire.<bt_wait>
So I went crazy.<bt_wait>
I killed everyone, friend and foe alike.<bt_wait>

I still don't know what got into me.<bt_wait>

As soon as I ran out of energy, my friends...<bt_wait>
Those who used to be my friends captured me.<bt_wait>

They took me apart, examined me, and threw away my body.<bt_wait>
I've been watching the real world from this memory space ever since.<bt_wait>

You've seen them too, right?<bt_wait>

The ones who only care about getting stronger.<bt_wait>
The ones who discriminate against machine lifeforms.<bt_wait>
The ones caught in their own web of rules.
</page>

<page>
They're all selfish idiots.<bt_wait>

But I'm in no place to make fun of them.<bt_wait>
Because my heart has been consumed by something too.<bt_wait>

After I went berserk, the machines grew to fear dolls.<bt_wait>
Even now, they gather dolls together and destroy them.<bt_wait>
Every day, the dolls are being destroyed.<bt_wait>
And I keep watching from this memory space, every single day.<bt_wait>

Why did I do what I did?<bt_wait>
What did I lose in the process?<bt_wait>

Who<bt_wait> is the truly<bt_wait> crazy one here?
