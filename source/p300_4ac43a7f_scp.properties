M3020_S0024_G0180_001_a9s=Now they're just messing with us...
M3040_S0090_S0000_001_a9s=There's something written here, too...
M3040_S0100_G0000_300_pod153=Analysis: Access to elevator control system blocked by external factor.
M3040_S0100_G0010_001_pod153=It reads "soul box."
M3040_S0100_G0010_300_pod153=Proposal: Hack into devices blocking elevator controls.
M3040_S0100_G0020_001_a9s=...No enemies?
M3040_S0100_G0020_300_a9s=What's this?
M3040_S0100_G0030_001_a9s=Oh, I get it.
M3040_S0100_G0030_300_pod153=Analysis: There are two blocking devices on this floor.
M3040_S0100_G0040_001_a9s=I have to break the system protection before I can reach the core.
M3040_S0100_G0040_300_pod153=Proposal: Hack into all blocking devices.
M3040_S0100_G0050_001_a9s=Huh. So that's how it works.
M3040_S0100_G0050_300_pod153=Analysis: There are three blocking devices on this floor.
M3040_S0100_G0060_001_a9s=That huge structure is some kind of launch platform.
M3040_S0100_G0060_300_a9s=Yeah, and I hack into all of 'em, right?
M3040_S0100_G0070_001_a9s=A structure that size could probably shoot something into space pretty easily.
M3040_S0100_G0070_300_pod153=All elevator controls unlocked.
M3040_S0100_G0080_001_a9s=......
M3040_S0100_G0080_300_pod153=Proposal: Investigate the next area.
M3040_S0100_G0090_001_a9s=So this is some kind of cannon aimed at the human server on the moon?
M3040_S0100_G0090_300_pod153=Hypothesis: This area should be investigated in order to meet the mission objective.
M3040_S0100_G0100_001_pod153=Insufficient data. Cannot confirm or deny.
M3040_S0100_G0100_300_announce=We have a special present for you\u2014a token of appreciation for all the machine lifeform requests you completed!
M3040_S0100_G0110_001_a9s=Damn it!
M3040_S0100_G0110_300_announce=Congratulations! As thanks for all the android requests you completed, we have a special present for you!
M3040_S0100_G0120_001_a9s=The YoRHa black box circuitry...
M3040_S0100_G0120_300_announce=As a reward for trying to understand machine lifeforms via frequent hacking sessions, we have a special present for you!
M3040_S0100_G0130_001_a9s=It's made from cores from the machines?
M3040_S0100_G0130_300_announce=It's wonderful to see your interest in the things of this world.\nThe collection you've amassed has earned you a special present!
M3040_S0100_G0140_001_a9s=That's... No.
M3040_S0100_G0140_300_announce=Goodness! You've died an astonishing number of times.\nYou deserve a special present!
M3040_S0100_G0150_001_a9s=That can't be true.
M3040_S0100_G0150_300_announce=Oh my! Look at all the machine lifeforms you've murdered!\nSuch dogged persistence is worthy of a special present!
M3040_S0100_G0160_300_announce=Heavens, you've used a veritable mountain of items, haven't you?\nPlease have this special present as a reward!
M3040_S0100_G0170_300_announce=You've recovered an army's worth of corpses!\nWe have just the thing for someone like you!
