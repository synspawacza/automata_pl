M5221_S0000_G0000_300_robochild=Did you get us anything yet?
M5221_S0000_G0010_300_robochildren=Still nothing!?
M5221_S0000_G0020_300_robochild=This is sooo fuuuun!
M5221_S0000_G0030_300_robochildren=Yaaaaay! Fuuuuuun!
M5221_S0010_G0000_001_robochild=Sis! Hey, Big Sis!
M5221_S0010_G0010_001_a2=Huh?
M5221_S0010_G0020_001_robochildren=C'mon, Big Sis! Play with us!
M5221_S0010_G0030_001_a2=I don't play with machines. Now get lost.
M5221_S0010_G0040_001_robochildren=C'moooooon! I wanna plaaaaay with you!
M5221_S0010_G0050_001_a2=I'm an android, weirdo. I'm your enemy.
M5221_S0010_G0060_001_a2=So do what I say before I kick your sorry ass!
M5221_S0010_G0070_001_robochildren=Tee hee hee! You're funny.
M5221_S0010_G0080_001_a2=That's not supposed to make you happy!
M5221_S0010_G0090_001_robochild=Big Sis! Make us something to play on, Big Sis!
M5221_S0010_G0100_001_a2=What? No.
M5221_S0010_G0110_001_robochild=But we need something to play on!
M5221_S0010_G0120_001_robochildren=Yeah! It's boooooring right now!
M5221_S0010_G0130_001_a2=Seriously...?
M5221_S0010_G0140_001_robochild=They sell stuff in the tool shop, so go buy us something!
M5221_S0010_G0141_001_robochild=By the way, the children said they wanted to thank you personally.
M5221_S0010_G0150_001_robochildren=Yeah! Buy something for us!
M5221_S0010_G0160_001_sele=Purchase something for the children.
M5221_S0010_G0170_001_sele=Keep your money.
M5221_S0010_G0180_001_a2=All right, all right! Just quit bugging me already.
M5221_S0010_G0190_001_robochildren=Yaaaaaay! We did it!
M5221_S0010_G0200_001_a2=I'm not buying you squat.
M5221_S0010_G0210_001_robochildren=Nooooo! You have tooooo!
M5221_S0010_G0220_001_a2=Dammit...
M5221_S0010_G0230_001_robotoolshop=Welcome!
M5221_S0010_G0240_001_robotoolshop=...You're looking for play equipment for the children?
M5221_S0010_G0250_001_robotoolshop=I'm afraid we don't have anything like that in stock at the moment.
M5221_S0010_G0260_001_robotoolshop=However, I'm sure I could build something with the proper materials.
M5221_S0010_G0270_001_robotoolshop=Tell you what\u2014here's a list of what I'll need.
M5221_S0010_G0280_001_robotoolshop=Bring me those materials and I can get to work.
M5221_S0010_G0290_001_a2=......
M5221_S0010_G0300_001_a2=Everyone around here is weirdly pushy.
M5221_S0010_G0310_001_robotoolshop=Don't be absurd! We are not.
M5221_S0010_G0320_001_a2=Fine, I'll do it. You'll just bug me about it every waking minute of my life otherwise.
M5221_S0010_G0330_001_robotoolshop=An excellent choice!
M5221_S0010_G0340_001_robotoolshop=You should be able to find what you need at the amusement park.
M5221_S0010_G0350_001_a2=Oh, hell. That's forever from here!
M5221_S0010_G0360_001_robotoolshop=Safe travels!
M5221_S0010_G0370_001_a2=This is going to suck...
M5221_S0010_G0380_001_robotoolshop=You should be able to find what you need at the amusement park.
M5221_S0010_G0390_001_robotoolshop=Safe travels!
M5221_S0020_G0000_001_a2=Finally...
M5221_S0020_G0010_001_a2=This should be everything I need to make those bratty kids happy.
M5221_S0020_G0020_001_a2=Better take it to that creep in the tool shop...
M5221_S0030_G0000_001_robotoolshop=Did you find the materials? Excellent!
M5221_S0030_G0010_001_robotoolshop=Just give me a moment...
M5221_S0030_G0011_001_robotoolshop=5 minutes later...
M5221_S0030_G0020_001_robotoolshop=Done! I've built what you requested and installed it where the children like to play.
M5221_S0030_G0030_001_a2=That was fast.
M5221_S0030_G0040_001_robotoolshop=They're at the top of the village playing near the slide. They'll be happy to see you, I'm sure.
M5221_S0030_G0050_001_robochild=Hey, it's Big Sis!
M5221_S0030_G0060_001_robochildren=Big Sis!
M5221_S0030_G0070_001_robochild=Thanks for building this, Big Sis!
M5221_S0030_G0080_001_robochildren=Yeah, thanks!
M5221_S0030_G0090_001_a2=Uh, sure.
M5221_S0030_G0100_001_robochild=Hey, Big Sis?
M5221_S0030_G0110_001_a2=Huh? What now!?
M5221_S0030_G0120_001_robochild=Um...we just wanna...give you something? 'Cause you helped us?
M5221_S0030_G0130_001_robochild=It's a thank-you present!
M5221_S0030_G0140_001_robochildren=Yeah! Thank you!
M5221_S0030_G0150_001_a2=Yep. It's a thrill a minute.
M5221_S0030_G0160_001_pascal=Ah! A2!
M5221_S0030_G0170_001_a2=Argh! Don't do that, Pascal.
M5221_S0030_G0180_001_pascal=I apologize if I scared you.
M5221_S0030_G0190_001_pascal=I heard you built some play equipment for our children and wanted to thank you in person.
M5221_S0030_G0200_001_a2=Don't worry about it.
M5221_S0030_G0215_001_pascal=Try not to overwork yourself, all right?
M5221_S0030_G0220_001_pascal=Feel free to pay us another visit whenever you like.
M5221_S0030_G0221_001_pascal=A group of pacifist machines, huh?
M5221_S0030_G0222_001_pascal=Hypothesis: Forming a harmonious relationship with Pascal and the villagers may help unit A2 to obtain more materials.
M5221_S0030_G0223_001_pascal=Proposal: Investigate the village.
M5221_S0030_G0224_001_pascal=Hmph.
M6050_S0010_G1920_300_ps=Look around as much as you like.
