M6010_S0090_G0060_300_op=We finally defeated Eve.
M6010_S0090_G0070_300_op=Thank you, 2B.
M6010_S0090_G0080_300_op=You did great, 2B.
M6010_S0090_G0090_300_op=Thank you so much for all you've done!
M6010_S0090_G0480_300_op=2B! Did you get Eve's data? Give it to me! Gimmegimmegimme!
M6010_S0090_G0490_300_ys=Calm down already! There's plenty of time for that later. Sheesh...
M6010_S0090_G0500_300_op=You must be tired after all that machine killing, right? You should buy some recovery items.
M6010_S0090_G0510_300_op=Personally, I think you should get everything for free since you were so amazing! But I don't make the rules, so whatcha gonna do?
M6010_S0090_G0630_300_ysA=*urp* Oh man, I think I'm gonna... BLAAAAAARGH!
M6010_S0090_G0640_300_ysB=Relax! Thanks to 2B, you won't have to ride a flight unit nearly as much as before!
M6010_S0090_G0650_300_ysA=R-Really!? Oh my gosh, thank youuuu!
M6010_S0090_G0660_300_ysA=Thank you so muc\u2014BLUUUUUURGH!
M6010_S0090_G0670_300_ysA=Say, I have an idea! Why don't we port Eve's self-regenerative function into our flight units?
M6010_S0090_G0680_300_ysB=Hey, that's a great idea! Think how much we'd save in repair costs!
M6010_S0090_G0690_300_op=Are you people INSANE!? We'd all get infected by a virus and DIE!
M6010_S0090_G0700_300_ysA=Ha ha! Kidding! We were just...kidding. Yeah, that's it...
M6010_S0090_G0710_300_ysA=Still a good idea... *grumble grumble*
M6010_S0100_G0060_300_op=I'll do whatever I can to help you from here. Good luck.
M6010_S0100_G0070_300_op=We can do this!
M6010_S0100_G0080_300_op=Let's put an end to all this fighting once and for all.
M6010_S0100_G0090_300_op=My data-processing functions just underwent a full tune-up, so you can count on me to support you!
M6010_S0100_G0440_300_op=Good luck.
M6010_S0100_G0450_300_ys=Understood.
M6010_S0100_G0460_300_op=Why don't you equip yourself before you go?
M6010_S0100_G0570_300_ysA=All right... Let's get down there and kick some machi\u2014BLUUUURGH!
M6010_S0100_G0580_300_ysB=Um, can you please try not to puke while we're in the deep vacuum of space? It's super gross.
M6010_S0100_G0590_300_ysA=You ready?
M6010_S0100_G0600_300_ysB=Yep. Let's do it.
M6010_S0100_G0610_300_op=Good luck.
