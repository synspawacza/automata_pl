M3060_S0600_G0000_001_a2=Damn it...
M3060_S0600_G0010_001_pod042=Alert: Enemy hacking detected.
M3060_S0600_G0020_001_pod042=Proposal: Retreat immediately.
M3060_S0600_G0030_001_a2=Who ARE you!?
M3060_S0600_G0040_001_girls=Good to see you again...Number Two.
M3060_S0600_G0050_001_girls=Or should we call you A2 now?
M3060_S0600_G0060_001_girls=This does bring back memories.
M3060_S0600_G0070_001_girls=Though to concepts like us, time has little meaning.
M3060_S0600_G0080_001_girls=Still, when we wiped out your forces, it made quite the impression on us.
M3060_S0600_G0090_001_girls=YoRHa attacker model Number Two...
M3060_S0600_G0100_001_girls=An experimental, disposable group created as a test run for Project YoRHa.
M3060_S0600_G0110_001_a2=Shut up!
M3060_S0600_G0120_001_girls=You're an obstinate little android, aren't you?
M3060_S0600_G0130_001_girls=Didn't we say that you can't kill us?
M3060_S0600_G0140_001_a2=God damn it!
M3060_S0600_G0150_001_pod042=Proposal:
M3060_S0600_G0160_001_a2=What now!?
M3060_S0600_G0170_001_pod042=Utilize the enemy's logical learning function to formulate a weakness.
M3060_S0600_G0180_001_a2=I don't know what that means!
M3060_S0600_G0190_001_pod042=This Pod has serious concerns about unit A2's cognitive abilities.
M3060_S0600_G0200_001_a2=SHUT UP AND EXPLAIN IT ALREADY!
M3060_S0600_G0210_001_pod042=Said strategy would interrupt the enemy's logic circuits, causing a computational delay.
M3060_S0600_G0220_001_a2=Meaning what!?
M3060_S0600_G0230_001_pod042=Do not destroy the enemy.
M3060_S0600_G0240_001_a2=Huh!?
M3060_S0600_G0250_001_pod042=Striking at the logic circuit requires a certain number of enemies to remain extant for a certain period of time.
M3060_S0600_G0260_001_a2=Oh, what the hell...
M3060_S0600_G0270_001_pod042=The enemy's processing speed has returned to normal.
M3060_S0600_G0280_001_pod042=Proposal: Do not destroy enemies.
M3060_S0600_G0290_001_a2=I know, all right!?
M3060_S0600_G0300_001_pod042=Consciousness data saturation rate 30 percent.
M3060_S0600_G0301_001_girls=It's all so very amusing...
M3060_S0600_G0310_001_pod042=Consciousness data saturation rate 60 percent.
M3060_S0600_G0311_001_girls=The androids the human race left behind acted as if they wanted to be human.
M3060_S0600_G0312_001_girls=The machine lifeforms the aliens left behind acted as if they wanted to be human.
M3060_S0600_G0313_001_girls=We resemble each other so, but we are networked, and thus we are superior to you.
M3060_S0600_G0320_001_pod042=Hypothesis: The enemy's defensive system is prompting an evolution of its logic.
M3060_S0600_G0321_001_girls=Foolish androids... Why do you resist?
M3060_S0600_G0322_001_girls=All things end with accepting death, do they not?
M3060_S0600_G0330_001_pod042=Consciousness data saturation rate 90 percent.
M3060_S0600_G0331_001_girls=We are one, and yet we are many.
M3060_S0600_G0332_001_girls=We are finite, and yet we are infinite.
M3060_S0600_G0333_001_girls=We are the embodiment of the perfect being.
M3060_S0600_G0340_001_pod042=Hypothesis: The enemy has become aware of the diversity of life.
M3060_S0600_G0341_001_girls=Ahh... I see it... The light...
M3060_S0600_G0342_001_girls=We move on... Forward... To the future!
M3060_S0600_G0350_001_pod042=Consciousness data saturation rate 100 percent.
M3060_S0600_G0360_001_pod042=Hypothesis: The enemy's consciousness has begun to fracture.
M3060_S0620_G0000_001_a2=What the\u2014!?
M3060_S0620_G0010_001_pod042=Analysis: The saturated consciousnesses are now in conflict with each other.
M3060_S0620_G0020_001_a2=Huh...
M3060_S0620_G0030_001_a2=They're acting like humans...
