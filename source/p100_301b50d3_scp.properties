M0010_S0220_G1030_101_a9s=2B? Uh, ma'am?
M0010_S0220_G1040_101_a2b=What is it?
M0010_S0220_G1050_101_a9s=I was going to send you the map data I collected earlier.
M0010_S0220_G1060_101_a2b=Do it.
M0010_S0220_G1110_101_a9s=You know, ma'am, I'm glad you're here.
M0010_S0220_G1120_101_a2b=Why?
M0010_S0220_G1130_101_a9s=Scanners like me mostly work alone. Scouting out enemy lines and all that?
M0010_S0220_G1140_101_a9s=I don't usually get a partner. It's kind of fun!
M0010_S0220_G1150_101_a2b=...Emotions are prohibited.
M0010_S0220_G1160_101_a9s=S-sorry, ma'am!
M0010_S0220_G1170_101_a2b=And another thing...
M0010_S0220_G1180_101_a2b=Stop calling me "ma'am".
M0010_S0220_G1190_101_a9s=Huh?
M0010_S0220_G1200_101_a2b=It's unnecessary.
M0010_S0220_G1210_101_a9s=All right, then. 2B it is!
M0010_S0220_G1220_101_a2b=This place sure is big.
M0010_S0220_G1230_101_a9s=I guess humans used to use it as a weapons factory.
M0010_S0220_G1240_101_a9s=But now it's just crawling with machines.
M0010_S0220_G1250_101_a9s=The enemy seems to have repurposed the facility to increase their overall machine production.
M0010_S0220_G1260_101_a2b=So if we don't destroy it, they'll just keep coming.
M0010_S0220_G1266_101_a2b=...What?
M0010_S0220_G1267_101_a9s=It's just accessing random nonsensical data from the old world.
M0010_S0220_G1268_101_a9s=There's no actual meaning behind anything machines do.
M0010_S0700_G0032_101_a9s=You mean the birds?
M0010_S0700_G0033_101_a9s=Yeah, there's more plants and animals here than there used to be. Probably because the environment's changed.
M0010_S0700_G1031_101_a2b=Is that...?
M0010_S0700_G1040_101_a2b=I surveyed the entire factory, but couldn't find anything resembling our target.
M0010_S0700_G1060_101_a9s=Maybe they...I dunno. Moved it somewhere?
M0010_S0700_G1061_101_a9s=There should be another facility across that bridge.
M0010_S0700_G1062_101_a9s=It's a bit of a hike, but should we check it out?
M0010_S0700_G1070_101_a9s=It's not like Command to get a location wrong. I guess even they get bad intel from time to time, huh?
M0010_S0700_G1080_101_a2b=Hmm.
M0010_S0700_G1090_101_a2b=I wouldn't bet on that.
M0010_S0733_G0000_201_a9s=2B? Wh-what's going on!?
M0010_S0733_G0005_001_a2b=
M0010_S0733_G0010_201_pod153=She appears to be engaging the target enemy.
M0010_S0733_G0020_201_a9s=We have to help her! Let's go!
