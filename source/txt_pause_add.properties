PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1003_01=In the capital of a distant Eastern land, there lived a poet who was devoted to his art. But his words failed to touch the hearts of the people, and he could make no profit from them. Soon, his life became unbearably hard.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1003_02=Seeing the limits of his talent, the poet chose to abandon the pen and work the land instead. Soon, his lily white skin began to grow dark, and his once frail body became sinewy and tough.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1003_03=He eventually married a kind woman, and several years later, they had a child. As the peaceful, uneventful days went on, the man began to feel that there could be no greater happiness in life.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1003_04=Or so the poet wrote before he put down his pen, swallowed the paper whole, and prayed that the next life might turn out so well. He then took Faith\u2014already stained with the blood of another\u2014and plunged it deep into his chest.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1013_01=Dad, if you're cold, I can give you my hat.\nYou're the best father in the world, after all!
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1013_02=Dad, if you're hungry, you can have my cookie.\nYou're my favorite person in the world, after all!
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1013_03=Dad, if you're scared, I can sleep by your side.\nYou're my closest friend in the world, after all!
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1013_04=So please don't go anywhere. All right, Dad?\nDon't leave your Yonah all alone.\n...Okay?
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1020_01=Once upon a time, there were three princesses. The middle princess wasn't very bright, but was renowned by all as a great beauty. Once she came of age, she was married off to the king of a neighboring nation.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1020_02=The neighboring king adored his new wife and treasured her looks above all else. He gave the middle princess six new dresses and eight fresh flowers every day, and his love caused her beauty to shine all the more.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1020_03=The middle princess did all she could to remain beautiful for her king, but she knew time would eventually catch up with her, as it did for all. So after much hard thought, she developed a cunning plan.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1020_04=The middle princess had herself stuffed and mounted so she could remain beautiful for all time. The king wept joyful tears at the sight, but alas, two years later, war broke out, and her body was crushed under the rubble of the castle.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1040_01=The girl lay there on the day of her wedding. Her parents and beloved were dead, and she herself had been violated in front of their corpses. As she swore to kill those who had done this terrible deed, a shining songbird appeared.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1040_02="Allow me to grant your wish," said the bird. "Wish upon this dagger, and never forget this hatred that you feel." The girl grasped the weapon and spat out a tearful curse: "I vow not to forget. Please! Give them a painful death!"
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1040_03=Time passed, and eventually, she got her revenge. Years later, when she was an old woman, the songbird appeared anew. "What of your vow?" it asked. But she did not understand. And come to think of it, what became of her beloved dagger?
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1040_04=That night, bandits broke into her house, assaulted her daughter, and murdered her grandchild. The songbird then reappeared with a single question: "How long will your hatred burn this time?"
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1030_01=One day, a young girl's village was sacked by bandits. To protect her family, she took up a dagger her father had found in the mountains and killed one of them, an act that shocked her family. But the bandits fled, never to return.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1030_02=Five years passed. Then ten. Then twenty. Though the family she protected began to grow old, the girl never aged. Eventually the other villagers began to shun her.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1030_03=With no one to turn to, she finally left her village and began to wander the earth, visiting many strange lands in the process. As the years passed, her skill and fame as a master swordfighter grew to legend.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1030_04=Eternal life, a powerful weapon, and boundless experience\u2014she used these talents to become queen of a nation. And yet, there was emptiness in her life, for she still desired the kindness her family denied her after that fateful day.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1050_01=YoRHa R&D Team Journal: August 29\nHeld a progress-report meeting for the new weapon. Considering how many observers we have from the other orbiting satellites, I can tell they expect a lot from us.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1050_02=YoRHa R&D Team Journal: December 10\nWe had our first core-installation experiment today. Saw some troubling signs, including issues with unexpected irregular output and core perimeter defenses. 
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1050_03=YoRHa R&D Team Journal: January 8\nThe circuits of three consecutive staffers burned out after attempting to remove the core's protection. I've requested replacement personnel.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1050_04=YoRHa R&D Team Journal: January 15\nCommand pulled the plug on our project. The weapon will go into official operation with the core still sealed.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1060_01=The craftsman's weapons were neither flashy nor attractive, but they never once failed in battle. This reliability afforded him a never-ending stream of loyal clients.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1060_02=Yet something nagged at the craftsman. Though he'd forged many a weapon, he'd only tested them on pigs and cows. He wondered what it might feel like to use them on another human being.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1060_03=The craftsman took a sword to a battlefield and slashed at corpses, disappointed at how easily the sword slid through them. It wasn't satisfying at all. He wanted to really feel like he was ripping through flesh.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1060_04=The craftsman modified a sword in search of that feeling, not thinking at all of the pain it would cause\u2014until one night, a bandit broke into his home, snatched the weapon up, and showed him exactly how effective it was.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1070_02=How long can I continue to protect what I love amidst this endless war? How long, I wonder?
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1070_03=How long can I continue to believe in a world laden with deceit and folly? How long, I wonder?
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1070_04=How long can I lie to myself as I despair at the dark future of this world? How long, I wonder?
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1071_01=Once, long ago, there was a group of seven boys who were born in the same village. Though they were not brothers by blood, they treated each other as family.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1071_02=One cold night, a fortune-teller appeared and warned of a traitor among them. The boys laughed it off and went about their business, but the next morning, one of them lay dead.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1071_03=With each passing night, another boy died. The survivors grew more and more suspicious of each other, each harboring terrible doubts about what happened to their brothers.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1071_04=On the morning of the seventh day, a single survivor stood tall. Cleaning the blood from his hands, he chuckled to himself. "Better go find the traitor!"
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1080_01=Morning, listeners! It's time to kick off another installment of Listener Letters with your favorite radio idol, DJ 24D! Now let's get this day started right, shall we?
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1080_02=How's it going, listeners? Yeah, I know... You're all still thinking about that clean-up operation yesterday, right? We may have lost a lot of good people, but it's still our job to get up and at 'em, right!?
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1080_03=Howdy, listeners! Your favorite radio idol DJ 24D hasn't been receiving many letters lately. Don't you like me anymore? Ha ha! Or maybe no one is even listening? Whee hee hee! Anyway, who's ready to kick things off?
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1080_04=Hello? Is anyone there? Is this thing even on? It's me, radio listeners! 24D! I'm an idol, remember? An idol! An idol an idol an idol an idol an idol an idol an idol an idol an idol an idol an idol an idol an idol an idol an
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1090_01=The more old records I read, the more fascinated I become by the species known as humans. We machines must do all we can to preserve these precious artifacts and continue to record their contents.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1090_02=I see from these records how important predation and reproduction were to human survival. And yet, they viewed such acts as sinful. I wonder why?
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1090_03=I found a famous human book today, but after reading it ten times, it still makes no sense to me. What possible attraction could there be to such a thing?
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1090_04=Eureka! It seems the answer was in front of me all along! I am simply incapable of comprehending anything\u2014about humanity OR the world in general! Ah, how wonderful it is to live in a world swaddled in mystery!
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1203_01=The sword's blade, dulled by years of idleness, was\u2014as its name implied\u2014a mere iron hunk. Its blood-drenched youth was little more than a series of rusted memories which grated against its pockmarked steel.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1203_02=Who could wield this hunk of iron now that its edge was gone? Who might love it when all it could do was bash dully against a foe instead of cutting through flesh and bone? Who would devote themselves to such insanity?
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1203_03=The sword sighed softly, pleased to finally be at rest. But before it could peacefully crumble into dust, a group of power-hungry fools took it up and denied its reverie anew.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1203_04=Red rust was the weapon's tears. The blood, fat, and muscle it tore through was proof of its curse. Now let it hew bone once more! Let it ravage flesh! Let it do all this and more as atonement for its sins!
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1213_01=Twin souls were sacrificed to twin gods and bound to an unbreakable dual-bladed axe. Whenever nicked or damaged, it would instantly repair itself. The two blades would never part. They would be together for the rest of time.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1213_02=The souls in the blade yearned to be as one. To grow old as one. To fall in love as one. It is why we both love the same person.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1213_03=I am myself. I am myself!\nLook at me. Look at me!\nGive me love. Give me love!\nStop copying me. I'm not!
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1213_04=We are together. We are one. Life or death. Even if we kill our foes. Even if we kill each other. Our two bodies will be as one for all time. Someone separate us. Oh god please someone help m
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1220_01=Once upon a time, there were three princesses. The eldest princess was thought by all to be the most brilliant woman in the kingdom, and she soon sat upon the throne of her homeland as their queen.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1220_02=The new queen raised a mighty army. To afford the endeavor, she taxed her people, and in turn, they were given jobs in new factories created to support the war effort.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1220_03=People worked. Money flowed. As the army grew strong, the demand for factories grew with it. And then the cycle repeated. More work. More money. More work. More money. The queen's plan proceeded just as she had envisioned it.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1220_04=TO FURTHER STRENGTHEN THE KINGDOM, WE WERE CONVERTED TO MACHINES TO ENHANCE OUR OUTPUT IN FACTORIES AND THE MILITARY. OUR QUEEN IN TURN BECAME THE CONTROL SYSTEM THAT RULES US TO THIS DAY.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1230_01=One day, a hawk lost its way in the woods. Its proud wings soon grew weak as it tried in vain to find its way home. As death approached, a songbird took pity on the hawk and did its best to offer aid.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1230_02=The songbird slowly nursed the hawk back to health. The beautiful sight of the small white bird nestled in the elegant wings of the hawk soon made it the envy of all the creatures in the forest.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1230_03=When the hawk was fully healed, it knew it was time to leave the forest. But before flying away, it promised the songbird it would one day return. In turn, the songbird gave the hawk one of its shining feathers as a token of friendship.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1230_04=As promised, the hawk eventually returned\u2014but with a human in tow. "Well done," said the human. "These feathers will sell for a great price at the market." Then he slew the songbird in one blow and plucked its carcass clean.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1240_01=Hi guys! It's me, 42S\u2014your favorite YoRHa Squadron idol from North 12C Defense HQ. I'm here with the latest hot scoops from the front line, so let's get out there and do our best, all right? Goooo team!

PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1250_01=The greatsword was known for the intense pain it inflicted upon its victims. This is what drove the man to carry it despite its weight, for he knew it would make others fear him, and thus could he avoid needless conflict.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1250_02=The man's reputation spread through the village despite never having drawn the blade. "Don't make him use that horrid weapon," the villagers whispered. The man smiled at this, for he knew that fear was the best path to peace.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1250_03=Soon, the man had craftsmen forge a host of similar weapons. He gave them to all the other villagers in the hope it would force people to solve conflicts with words instead of violence. And his plan worked...for a while.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1250_04=Keeping all sides in check is simple when no one uses their power. But once that seal is broken, the end is nigh. Thus did the peaceful village transform itself into a living hell over the space of a single night.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1260_02=FAILED TO CONNECT\nWITH\nMY LOVER

PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1261_01=I'll never forget the time we met. I knew ours was a love that would last for eternity.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1261_02=But even when by his side, his feelings were a mystery. It was painful not to know what he was thinking. So painful.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1261_03=When I was close, I hurt him. Yet being distant hurt him more.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1261_04=I finally found my place in life. A place where I am as close as possible, yet eternally distant. 
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1270_01=HuMAN fiGhT. WHy?
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1270_02=Why...humans love?
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1270_03=Why do humans band together?
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1270_04=You\u2014why are you alive?
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1400_01=Legends tell of a mighty warrior who had no equal in battle. Granted immortality by a phoenix, he wandered from war to war, forever searching for ways to prove his strength.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1400_02=Eventually, the man's immortal body proved too much for his spirit, and he ran himself through with his own spear again and again. But each time he did, the wound closed over itself, leaving not even a scar.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1400_03=He leapt from cliffs, threw himself into raging seas, and lit himself aflame, but nothing worked. Then, one day, he slipped mercifully into unconsciousness, and awoke centuries later to find a songbird on his chest.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1400_04="You have atoned for your sins," said the bird. "If you wish me to free you from your solitary existence, I will gladly do so." The man wept tears of joy and whispered thanks to the gods before suddenly stomping the bird to death.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1420_01=Once upon a time, there were three princesses. The youngest princess was widely regarded as the ugliest woman in all the land, but her heart was gentle, honest, and pure.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1420_02=Hoping to aid others in need, the youngest princess would travel to the fields to offer succor to peasants\u2014but they would reject her kindness with cruel words.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1420_03=The youngest princess knew her looks were driving people away, yet she kept donating her life to the service of others, figuring that the fault lay in her own lack of devotion. Day after day this continued, for years without end.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1420_04=The youngest princess died alone, curled in the back of a damp, wet alley. She was so ugly that no one had the courage to give her a proper burial. Instead, she rotted where she lay, turning ever uglier until she faded into the earth.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1430_01=I had a dream. A dream about the day we met. He was small. He was insignificant. He was weak. Yet he hated the world just as I did.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1430_02=I decided to aid him, and he did the same for me. Thus was our friendship born.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1430_03=It wasn't perfect, of course. Mistakes were made along the way. Still, we remained friends.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1430_04=The blue wind that caresses these grasslands has a pleasing scent. I bring my cheek to his and he twitches, almost as if tickled. Then I spread my wings and let him ride me into the skies above.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1440_01=In a distant kingdom, there lived two princes. The son of the queen consort was clever of mind but weak of flesh. The son of the king's second wife was dimwitted, yet charming, and quite gifted in the art of war.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1440_02=Which prince would succeed the throne? When news came down that the king had died in battle, the two men each declared themselves the next true king, rallying the people to take the side of one or the other.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1440_03=In the midst of this coronation battle, a third man appeared claiming to be a prince. Bright, capable, and brave, he dispatched the two foolish brothers and went on to become a wise and just king beloved by all.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1440_04=Decades later, the king announced on his deathbed that he wasn't royalty at all, but in fact was the son of a commoner. Upon hearing this revelation, the people stormed the castle and hung their beloved ruler from the rafters.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1450_01=Development Journal: 0504 Takada\nI've come up with an incredible idea\u2014something no one has ever done before. I'm going to start testing it out first thing in the morning.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1450_02=Development Journal: 0704 Takada\nThe boss turned down my idea of infusing metallic alloys with magical elements. Thrice-damned fool! Doesn't he see how much money we could make from this?
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1450_03=Development Journal: 1201 Takada\nThings aren't going well. My hair is falling out. I think it's the stress. I've got to find a way to make this project succeed, and soon!
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1450_04=Development Journal: 1215 Fujita\nI looked over the data, but couldn't work out the problem. I'm not giving up though. With Takada dead, it's up to me\u2014I'm the only one who can carry on his work...
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1460_01=The unadorned lance pierced her foes with machine-like accuracy. The grind of metal on bone in tandem with the pained screams of her victims created sweet music in the mercenary girl's ears.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1460_02=Day after day, she returned to the battlefield to compose more music. Here, a giant of a man, fat rippling from his sides. There, a slimmer gentleman whose bones would surely produce a sweeter sound. Ah, who to stab first!?
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1460_03=The girl fought for an age, stabbing uncountable foes in an effort to find the ideal scream\u2014that sonorous, bone-grinding sound. Yet perfection eluded her no matter how hard she tried. Would she ever find what she sought?
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1460_04=Suddenly, she turned to find a fine-looking hunk of meat at her side. Stabbing it produced a scream so pure, she couldn't help but smile. She continued to smile as she stabbed, no longer able to recall that the hunk was her own child.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1470_01=The elegant white spear was crafted by a tyrant as a gift for his wife\u2014whose parents he had killed years earlier. She slipped it under the bed they shared, then later used it to run him through 30 times.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1470_02=The spear's second owner was a courageous, bandit-fighting mayor. In her later years, her strength faded, until one night, a pack of young thugs surrounded her and took all that she had\u2014including her life.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1470_03=The third owner was a greedy merchant who lived to swindle customers. Soon, she found herself shunned and penniless, and so decided to hang herself. The unused spear rested in a corner of her home as a decoration.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1470_04=The fourth owner was a meek young boy who wanted to aid his sickly younger sister. He gave all to this cause\u2014including his very existence and that of all else in the world.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1471_01=The dark, hideous lance was crafted by a beautiful female artisan. As people far and wide praised its design, the artisan's apprentice grew jealous and slew her, the lance itself soon vanishing into the mists of time.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1471_02=The lance's second owner was a puppeteer who crafted a clockwork doll capable of doing nearly anything. When he put the lance in the doll's hand, she lashed out and pierced the puppeteer's skull right between the eyes.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1471_03=The third owner was an infant prince who was gifted the lance by the queen regent. She died soon thereafter, and on the night of her funeral, the lance vanished from the infant's room, leaving behind only a tiny corpse in the crib.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1471_04=The fourth owner was a simple, honest man who wanted to aid his sickly daughter. He gave all to this cause\u2014including his very existence and that of all else in the world.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1480_01=My name is Plato 1728. I am a failure of a machine. I was designed for combat, but I can't use weapons. Everyone makes fun of me, and my life is horrible.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1480_02=I am a dumb machine. I got lost during battle, and ended up in some kind of factory. I found a whole pile of dolls discarded there. They share the same fate I do.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1480_03=I am a foolish machine. Today, I had to fight at that factory. All of the dolls got completely destroyed. Crushed by my friends and foes, who can do nothing but fight fight fight.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1480_04=I activated my cannon and shot everyone there. I'm not sure why I did that. All I know is I decided to fight. Because I'm just a stupid, broken machine.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1640_01=Once, there was a demon who held an affinity for angels. He dreamed of serving alongside them and their god, yet cursed the impossibility of it all. Then one day, he came to earth, bringing himself a step closer to heaven.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1640_02=An angel was sent to slay the demon. When the evil one saw his foe, he burst into tears and revealed his plan. "Please," the demon begged, "you must give me a set of white wings for my very own!"
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1640_03=The angel agreed to trade a set of white wings for the head of another demon. Overjoyed, the demon killed one of his own and plucked the head right off its still-warm body.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1640_04=The angel then led the demon to heaven, where he underwent centuries of the cruelest tortures imaginable. Finally, the pain was so great that he lost consciousness\u2014at which point his dark wings turned the promised shade of white.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1630_01=Once, there was a gentle angel who came to earth to provide salvation for those in need. Whether it was curing illnesses, offering blessings, or cheering the sad, he was always there when needed.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1630_02=The angel, however, provided aid to sinners and non-believers as well\u2014an act which was strictly forbidden. Each time he did so, a single white feather would fall away from his glorious wings.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1630_03=One day, the angel came across a young girl with an illness that pained her deeply. But he could do nothing to help the child, for all his feathers had long since fallen off.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1630_04=The angel cursed both himself and the cruelty of the world. The resulting hatred stained his body and his wings, turning them both black as night. Then, crying tears of blood, he brought his hands to the girl's neck.

PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1600_01=The man wailed an inhuman scream as he brought his fist down on his opponent's skull. He brought it down again. And again. And again. Until the victim was nothing more than a splatter of blood and bits.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1600_02=The man had a beautiful wife that drove everyone wild with jealousy. They lived a simple, happy life, yet the man always strove to keep his wife safe above all else.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1600_03=One night, the man came home to find a stranger in his bed. His wife told him that he had forced himself on her, at which point the husband flew into a rage and vowed to exact revenge.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1600_04=The man bought a weapon from a craftsman famed for forging instruments of pain, then used it to punish his wife\u2014for he could not abide that she failed to protect her virtue. His revenge was complete.

PAUSE_ENEMY_000a=Equipped with a circular saw, these units use a reciprocating engine to spin the blade and slice through android armor.
PAUSE_ENEMY_0002=These machine lifeforms\u2014who evolved in the Desert Zone\u2014wear garments and engage in ceremonies based on the cultural rituals of past humans. The specific origin of this behavior is unknown, but it is assumed to be caused by contact with old human data.
PAUSE_ENEMY_0003=Gaudily dressed machine lifeforms deployed in the ruins of a human amusement park. Their love of parades make them seem rather friendly\u2014though their overall behavior and thought processes are something of a mystery. Note that while these units are generally peaceful, they will fight back if attacked.
PAUSE_ENEMY_0004=Machine lifeforms from the forest kingdom. Like soldiers from humanity's Middle Ages, these units wear armor and maintain discipline in battle, meaning caution must be exercised when confronting them in groups. Cut off from the network, they are extremely exclusionary toward other machine lifeforms.
PAUSE_ENEMY_0005=Machine lifeforms that formed a colony at the abandoned factory, where they don strange garments and engage in arcane, quasi-religious ceremonies. This behavior is thought to have started when they were cut off from the network. 
PAUSE_ENEMY_0006=Machine lifeforms covered in red and black paint. While they resemble standard machines aside from the color scheme, their internal specs are actually above average.
PAUSE_ENEMY_0007=Machine lifeforms that are part of the colony at Pascal's village. Despite their machine origins, they despise conflict in all forms, and willingly cut themselves off from the network as a result. They now live a peaceful existence deep in the forest along with other machines who share their pacifistic beliefs.
PAUSE_ENEMY_0009=Machine lifeforms with extendable necks that resemble the human spinal cord. They attack with electromagnetic pulses that interfere with a variety of functions.

PAUSE_ENEMY_001e=Certain units of this type have been known to replace their forearms with projectile weapons. In addition to standard energy rounds, these units are also capable of firing powerful lasers.
PAUSE_ENEMY_0020=A self-destruct device equipped with a medium bipedal unit. Such simple construction means it is technically not classified as a machine lifeform. Its only function is to approach enemies and engage the self-destruct\u2014a task made easier by a layer of thick armor.
PAUSE_ENEMY_0030=A medium-sized machine lifeform that has multiple legs, much like an insect. By emitting energy from the tips of its legs, it can move about as though gliding across the ground.
PAUSE_ENEMY_0050=A medium-sized machine lifeform outfitted with four flight devices. Armed with guns atop the devices and wire cutters on its sides, it's capable of taking on enemies in both close- and long-range combat. The wires on the bottom of the flight devices allow them to transport other machine lifeforms when necessary.
PAUSE_ENEMY_005a=Variations with self-destruct units on top of their flight devices have also been observed. Said self-destruct units detach from their airborne hosts before detonation, allowing them to rain down destruction from above.
PAUSE_ENEMY_0060=This humanoid, Goliath-class machine lifeform is actually a colony of smaller machines that uses their combined energy to move one massive body. The expandable slide-rail arms punish all who draw close, while the liquid-fuel rocket engine on its back grants short-lived flight abilities. It also boasts powerful projectile weapons and the transport apparatuses of the linked machines that comprise it, making it a dangerous foe with no apparent weaknesses.
PAUSE_ENEMY_006a=This model has enhanced leg power and a body that's flipped upside down. Unlike the standard model, it is quite agile. The rocket engine on its back is used when attacking from the air, propelling diving kicks toward the ground.
PAUSE_ENEMY_0070=A small machine lifeform with limbs similar to those of a human. Its less-than-sizeable build makes it well-suited to swift attacks.
PAUSE_ENEMY_007a=Its small sword is thought to have been created by a machine lifeform haphazardly combining metals.
PAUSE_ENEMY_007b=Occasionally, machine lifeforms can be found carrying torches in dark places. As machines are thought to be capable of seeing in the dark, it's assumed they have some other reason for this behavior. They tend to use their own vital fluids as fuel for the torches, though the meaning of this\u2014if there is one\u2014is also unknown.
PAUSE_ENEMY_007c=The tip of its spear is made of painstakingly refined metals, and can pierce even an android's armor.
PAUSE_ENEMY_007d=The weight of its axe gives it overwhelming destructive power. Wielders should be approached with a good deal of caution.
PAUSE_ENEMY_0080=A self-destruct device equipped with a small bipedal unit. Such simple construction means it is technically not classified as a machine lifeform. Its only function is to approach enemies and engage the self-destruct\u2014a task made easier by its impressive speed.
PAUSE_ENEMY_0090=A four-legged, medium-sized machine lifeform that resembles an animal. Occasionally seen with smaller machines riding on its back, this unit attacks using the great mobility afforded by its legs. The tips of its limbs are equipped with wire cutters that can be used in combat, while the tail segment is actually a collapsible claw-like arm.
PAUSE_ENEMY_009a=This variant resembles a human when upright. Its slim body allows it to attack with unusual swiftness.
PAUSE_ENEMY_0100=This Goliath-class machine lifeform is a vivid reminder of the dinosaurs of antiquity. The artillery built into its arms allows it to attack with a variety of projectiles.
PAUSE_ENEMY_0110=Created by stacking the bodies of multiple small stubbies, this sluggish machine lumbers ever northward and performs no proper attacks. One is left to wonder why it even exists at all.
PAUSE_ENEMY_011a=This unusual type of machine utilizes various types of both firearm and body units. When attacking, it scatters great quantities of energy bullets across the battlefield.
PAUSE_ENEMY_0120=This combination of multiple spherical machines is sometimes transported into combat by its comrades. Its many variations are a result of its unusual construction, which emphasizes flexibility above all else.
PAUSE_ENEMY_0130=This spherical machine lifeform requires tremendous energy to stay afloat, so offense is not its strong suit. It offsets this by equipping weapons that are powerful enough to make up for its inherent lack of strength.
PAUSE_ENEMY_0140=A YoRHa member infected by a virus. Having completely lost all sense of self, it is hostile toward all uninfected androids.
PAUSE_ENEMY_0150=A YoRHa member infected by a virus. This armed model\u2014which specializes in combat\u2014also possesses heavy armor and remarkable defensive abilities.
PAUSE_ENEMY_0160=A YoRHa member infected by a virus. Equipped with a flight unit, it prefers to attack unsuspecting foes from above. This opponent is every bit as formidable as one would expect considering the costly equipment at its disposal.
PAUSE_ENEMY_0170=A YoRHa member infected by a virus. Operators are not typically suited for combat, but exposure to the virus has caused its specs to exceed their standard functions. Such enhancements come at a significant price to both its body and systems, however.
PAUSE_ENEMY_0180=Found in the ruins of an amusement park, this tank-like, Goliath-class machine lifeform has a tread-based system of locomotion that lets it cover all manner of terrain. Appearance-wise, the unit seems to be part of the park itself, right down to its decorative lights and a turret that fires colorful confetti. Strangely enough, it also insists on obeying archaic traffic laws, even going so far as to use turn signals and brake lights.
PAUSE_ENEMY_0190=A tank-like, Goliath-class machine lifeform found at the abandoned factory. It requires a number of smaller units to function, including a commander in the top section of the turret, an operator in the front chamber, and various other machines scattered throughout. The top-mounted cannon is capable of firing energy rounds and powerful lasers, while the front contains an arm-like structure that can strike and cleave foes with ease. Finally, the rear section boasts both an attacking hammer on a crane and a cargo unit that can carry additional machines into battle.
PAUSE_ENEMY_0200=A flying, Goliath-class machine lifeform with a tank-like machine attached to its bottom section. During combat, the center portion functions as a hanger that can release numerous small flying machines, while the main body is capable of firing large quantities of energy rounds.
PAUSE_ENEMY_0210=A multi-legged, Goliath-class machine lifeform equipped with two massive blades. By emitting energy from the tips of its legs, it can move about as though gliding across the ground. The unit's sides serve as weapon racks that can launch missiles and other projectiles, while additional plating attached to the legs reinforces its weak armor. When the situation demands it, the unit can purge this plating and transform into a spherical form capable of spin attacks.
PAUSE_ENEMY_0220=A multi-legged, Goliath-class machine lifeform. Equipped with an offensive firearm unit, this long-range menace can also emit electricity from the tips of its legs, turning nearby water-covered surfaces into danger zones.

PAUSE_ENEMY_0260=A unit formed through the linking of several multi-legged, Goliath-class machine lifeforms. Its colossal energy output is enough to keep even its enormous body afloat, and also permits it to separate and rejoin at will while unleashing a variety of attacks.
PAUSE_ENEMY_0270=A machine lifeform that plays the role of older brother to countless followers. It has the appearance of a standard medium-sized biped save for its arms\u2014which are formed from a number of linked-sphere type machines. Be wary when approaching, for it has been known to display tremendous anger when its brothers are harmed.
PAUSE_ENEMY_0280=A "little brother" machine lifeform that desperately poured oil into a machine he called his sibling.
PAUSE_ENEMY_0281=In the heat of battle, this unit begged for his brother's life to be spared\u2014only to see him cut down without mercy.
PAUSE_ENEMY_0282=In the heat of battle, this unit begged for his brother's life to be spared\u2014a requests A2 granted for unknown reasons.
PAUSE_ENEMY_0290=A Goliath-class machine lifeform modeled after an opera singer, this unit attacked foes using the repurposed bodies of living androids. Obsessed with a certain other machine lifeform, she put great thought into her appearance\u2014even going so far as to cannibalize her own kind. Alas, such garish decorations only ended up being a spectacular display of poor taste. Her search for beauty eventually led to her demise when she attacked 2B and 9S.
PAUSE_ENEMY_0320=A machine lifeform of extreme size that was developed specifically to annihilate androids. However, due to its tendency to also attack its fellow machines, it was eventually discarded into the sea. The part that was initially thought to be its entire body turned out to be merely its head, causing this colossus to reach over 1,000 meters into the sky when standing. Seemingly invincible due to powerful EMP defenses and thick armor, the unit was eventually destroyed when 9S directed missiles straight into its mouth.
PAUSE_ENEMY_0330=This unit has achieved an unusual level of evolution among machine lifeforms, as it possesses a strong resemblance to androids. It first appeared after splitting off from another machine.
PAUSE_ENEMY_0331=Eve was again encountered in the alien mothership. He has the ability to regenerate no matter how many times he is killed, and adores the unit known as Adam\u2014who he thinks of as an older brother.
PAUSE_ENEMY_0332=After going mad with rage over the loss of Adam, Eve gained the ability to unleash powerful attacks with an arm clad in debris. Thanks to the desperate hacking work of 9S, he was eventually separated from the network and killed.
PAUSE_ENEMY_0340=This unit has achieved an unusual level of evolution among machine lifeforms, as it possesses a strong resemblance to androids. Born naked from a cocoon of machine lifeforms, its movement was initially quite clumsy. It grew rapidly, however, and promptly began learning new methods of attack.
PAUSE_ENEMY_0341=Adam was again encountered inside the alien mothership. Strangely enough, he spent part of that fight lecturing his foes about how the aliens met their end at the hands of the machines. Deeply fascinated with mankind, he seeks to dissect the surviving humans on the moon.
PAUSE_ENEMY_0342=Adam also appeared in the Copied City. His fascination with humanity led him to create the Copied City in an attempt to imitate them. He then separated himself from the network and put his life on the line against 2B in an attempt to better understand the concepts of life and death. While he eventually gained the knowledge he sought, the price was his own life.
PAUSE_ENEMY_0350=Official name: "Terminal." A program projected by the network server of the machine lifeforms. The self-evolution program installed by the Pods eventually fractured its ego, causing the various aspects of its personality to turn on each other.
PAUSE_ENEMY_0360=Pronounced "two-one-oh." Calm and skilled at analysis, this operator was originally in charge of relaying messages to 9S. She personally requested to have her equipment transferred to a B-model for the drop, after which she joined the battle as 21B before going missing. She was eventually encountered again at the resource recovery unit in the amusement park ruins, where she had already been overrun by the virus. In the end, A2 had no choice but to take her life.
PAUSE_ENEMY_0370=These copies of the YoRHa B-model\u2014created by the Tower\u2014attacked 9S after being infected by a virus. Though 9S was eventually able to defeat them, the timed detonation of their bodies blew off his left arm.
PAUSE_ENEMY_0380=The A-model is a YoRHa prototype that specializes in close-quarter combat. Though not presently in use, it was originally created to speed along the implementation of other official models such as 2B and 9S. This particular unit\u2014whose official title is Class A, Number 2\u2014was wanted by Command for desertion and ordered to be destroyed on sight. She first appeared in the Forest Castle, where she slew the Forest King. 2B and 9S engaged her in combat, but she managed to escape.
PAUSE_ENEMY_0390=This unit's official title is Model S, Number 9. While this YoRHa member possessed offensive abilities, he specialized in survey missions\u2014and was particularly skilled at information gathering and hacking. While 9S normally had a kind personality, he began to exhibit hatred for A2 when she killed 2B\u2014for whom he possessed an unusually deep affection. In a cruel twist, he also met his end at the hands of A2.
PAUSE_ENEMY_0400=This mysterious creature emerged from inside of a machine lifeform and set up a shop after obtaining a new body. While he calls himself Emil, his true identity is a mystery. Once he discovered who had been stealing from his room, he was incited to fight. But after being defeated, he was reduced to tears by the realization that only power matters in this world.
PAUSE_ENEMY_0401=These colossal Emils were the sad final state of Emil's copies. Attacking without warning, they possessed the ability to unleash fierce attacks using magical weapons from the old world. At the end of this pitched battle, the true Emil stopped his doppelgangers with heartfelt words before annihilating them with a final strike. He then passed away with an expression of great relief, as if he had finally met the person he'd longed to see.
PAUSE_ENEMY_0410=A machine lifeform who lived in Pascal's village and was preoccupied with philosophy. Followers across the land regularly tried to win his favor with gifts, though he regarded such efforts with disdain. He eventually departed on a journey to learn the truth of the world and was never heard from again.

She presented Sartre with a gift of beautiful glass, only to have him reject it as a useless trinket\u2014a response that inexplicably made her happy.
PAUSE_ENEMY_2030=This Sartre fan from the desert, who wears clothing that reflects her view of the world, regards the philosopher as a passionate and inquiring mind. She also possesses a keen sense of smell, going so far as to sniff out the fact that 2B and 9S came from Pascal's village. She presented Sartre with a machine fossil, only to have him reject it as a trash\u2014a response that inexplicably made her happy.
PAUSE_ENEMY_2040=A machine lifeform that plays the role of father\u2014although he leaves the job of caring for his children entirely up to the mother.
PAUSE_ENEMY_2050=A machine lifeform that plays the role of mother. She reached out to 2B and 9S after a fight with her child caused him to run away\u2014a story which serves as proof that familial bonds exist amongst machines.
PAUSE_ENEMY_2051=Coolant leaked from the mother's eyes when her missing child finally returned home. Despite the lack of network access causing disagreements among her family, she still spoke happily of the incredible joy to be found in understanding.
PAUSE_ENEMY_2060=A child machine lifeform that fled home after a fight with its mother.
PAUSE_ENEMY_2061=This unit was saved by 2B and 9S after being attacked by other machine lifeforms. His dissatisfaction with being treated differently than his brothers caused him to run away from home, but he managed to patch things up without incident upon returning to his mother.
PAUSE_ENEMY_2070=A machine lifeform searching for her lost little sister. She ventured into the desert after overhearing her sibling complain about the poor condition of her parts. This story serves as proof that sisterhood exists among machines.
PAUSE_ENEMY_2080=A little-sister machine lifeform that got lost in the desert. According to Pascal, she's a good-natured girl who cares deeply for her older sister. Filled with curiosity, she spent most of the trip home bombarding 9S with uncountable questions. She returned home on her own after being escorted to the desert's entrance.
PAUSE_ENEMY_2090=A hasty machine lifeform that placed speed above all else. He challenged the party to a race, the winner of which would be named a true speedster. Afterward, he finally awakened to a calm within himself as he discovered the ugliness of competing with others. Thus satisfied with his life, he chose to end it on his own terms.
PAUSE_ENEMY_2100=This self-proclaimed genius sought investors for a once-in-a-lifetime invention\u2014a rocket which landed on Mars instead of the moon. Despite the project ending in failure, it also served to solidify his standing as a unique intellect.
PAUSE_ENEMY_2110=A machine lifeform who is endlessly mocked by the children in Pascal's village. Though he seems dense, he's actually a clever unit that possesses advanced thought circuitry. His less-than-clever facade is actually an elaborate act designed to grant him knowledge of others' true nature.
PAUSE_ENEMY_2120=One of the machine lifeforms known as Romeo. After spewing a non-stop diatribe of abuse, he suddenly descended into a murderous rampage.
PAUSE_ENEMY_2150=One of the machine lifeforms known as Juliet. After spewing a non-stop diatribe of abuse, she suddenly descended into a murderous rampage. She managed to survive the bloodbath that took the lives of her fellow Romeos and Juliets, but killed herself soon thereafter due to grief over the loss of her beloved.
PAUSE_ENEMY_2180=A blacksmith in the forest kingdom. His teacher was a master craftsman, known for improving the 8 legendary weapons of Virtue and Cruelty. He separated himself from the network due to an internal malfunction, so he is no longer hostile towards androids. He loves weapons more than anything, and as proof of your respect for weapons, he grants you the weapon his teacher honed.
PAUSE_ENEMY_000d=Units equipped with electromagnetic shields are immune to a Pod's projectile attacks, and also damage all who come into contact with its shield. Extreme care is recommended.
PAUSE_ENEMY_0019=Units equipped with electromagnetic shields are immune to a Pod's projectile attacks, and also damage all who come into contact with its shield. Extreme care is recommended.
PAUSE_FISH_01=An ancient freshwater fish. Though it lacks any real purpose, it was quite popular with some humans for some reason.
PAUSE_FISH_02=A two-headed freshwater fish that resembles an arowana, but is actually a different species entirely. The upper head constantly surveys the environment for threats, while the lower head searches the river bottom for food. Both heads are capable of independent thought, and its life span is said to be greatly affected by how well they get along.
PAUSE_FISH_03=A small freshwater fish, roughly an inch long. Because of its size, it often ends up getting tangled up inside machine lifeforms that venture into water, causing all kinds of interesting malfunctions. This led to attempts by androids to use the killifish as a weapon, but its military use was never approved\u2014mostly due to angry demonstrations by android  killifish fanatics, many of whom like to keep them as pets. Unfortunately for the killifish, they lack the same kind of determined lobbying efforts among machine lifeforms.
PAUSE_FISH_04=An extremely common\u2014and completely harmless\u2014freshwater fish.
PAUSE_FISH_05=A freshwater fish with a hugely inflated front part. The inflated part is very soft due to the air bladder inside, but it doesn't like being touched there very much.
PAUSE_FISH_06=This freshwater fish is nearly as common as the regular carp. It's quite resilient to contaminated environments, and can often be found where no other fish dare to tread.
PAUSE_FISH_07=An odd species of carp covered in hair\u2014which gives it the appearance of something one might find in a shower drain. This hair helps to maintain its body temperature, allowing the fish to survive on land for short periods of time. As a result, it's not uncommon to see them sunbathing near riverbanks.
PAUSE_FISH_08=A huge type of ray that contains sharp spines on its tail fin and should be approached with caution as a result. Many machine lifeforms travel in groups in hopes of catching a glimpse of this creature\u2014this is thought to be the result of a machine legend regarding a gigantic ray.
PAUSE_FISH_09=A large flesh-eating fish known as the King of the Rivers. It doesn't have a particular use, but the size and nasty temperament make you feel good about yourself when you catch one. Well done, you!
PAUSE_FISH_10=An unusual fish that lives in waste oil. The sheer amount of sludge coating its body makes it difficult to know what it actually looks like.
PAUSE_FISH_11=A flesh-eating crustacean that lived in fresh water a long time ago. Though tiny, it has surprisingly powerful claws.
PAUSE_FISH_12=An odd fish with heads at both sides of its body. However, it only looks like this during the first year of its life. Once it matures, the largest head becomes the actual head, while the other one just gives up and becomes a tail instead.
PAUSE_FISH_13=A large fish from the age of antiquity. They used to live in small numbers in the deep sea, but have lately been appearing in shallow waters.
PAUSE_FISH_14=A poisonous fish that can cause hallucinations when consumed. Some androids use components of this fish to create powerful drugs, but you really don't want to fall in with that crowd.
PAUSE_FISH_15=A large fish that swims with incredible speed. Known as the King of the Seas. It doesn't have a particular use, though it does make you feel good about yourself when you catch one. Huzzah for you!
PAUSE_FISH_16=A common poisonous fish. It congeals fluids inside android bodies when eaten, so its consumption has been outlawed. Strangely enough, it has no effect on humans.
PAUSE_FISH_17=An arthropod that lives in shallow waters. Their shells are used by some female androids to cover their chests in a sort of fashion statement. 
PAUSE_FISH_18=A species of beetle that once lived on land before evolving to hang out in the water instead. Still capable of flight, it can be seen soaring over the oceans during full moons.
PAUSE_FISH_19=This critter uses its five arms to move about, while the mouth at its center inhales dead fish and clams. Despite the appearance, it's actually quite friendly, and will often move closer if you try to touch it.
PAUSE_FISH_20=A fish that is roughly as common as a mackerel. Due to an infatuation with human behavior, some androids like to catch and consume the fish\u2014despite such sustenance being wholly unnecessary.
PAUSE_FISH_21=An incredibly large shark\u2014with a surprisingly warm personality\u2014that exists on a diet of plankton.
PAUSE_FISH_22=A machine lifeform resembling a killifish.\nDue to its wondrous appearance, some killifish fanatics among YoRHa soldiers have started keeping these creatures as pets, to the frustration and confusion of their commanders.
PAUSE_FISH_23=A machine lifeform resembling a koi carp.\n\nIt is surmised that fish machine lifeforms were created to scare away the real fish mankind used for food. (They look very much like the native species, so whoever made them did their job well.) Fish machines are also extremely aggressive, which helped deal a huge blow to the ecology of aquatic life on earth. Once they had fulfilled their purpose, all maintenance was stopped\u2014but they still managed to adapt to, and thrive in, their environments. As a result, current species are no longer hostile towards androids, and instead concentrate on not dying much like any other animal. In contrast to land-based machines, however, their data banks are no longer synced, so the evolution of their intelligence has pretty much ground to a halt.\n\nMany machine fish have formed symbiotic relationships with natural ones, allowing them to consume the sessile organisms on their bodies\u2014such as moss and barnacles\u2014in exchange for protection. With natural fish performing their maintenance, machine fish now live lives which are the exact opposite of what they were designed to do.\n\nIn recent years, new ecologies have been observed as a result of such symbiotic relationships. Some, for instance, have formed colonies in order to protect themselves, leading to increased aquatic life across the planet. Of course, the current ecology is quite different from when mankind still inhabited Earth, but the sheer quantity of fish is sure to be a surprise once they finally return from the moon.\n\nHowever, there are even bigger changes afoot. With no new fish machines being created, they are predicted to go extinct sometime over the next 150 years. Scientists are greatly interested in what may happen to the original native fish when they lose their mechanical protectors.
PAUSE_FISH_24=A machine lifeform resembling an arapaima. Due to its enormous size, it has no natural enemies, and thus resides safely at the top of the aquatic food chain. As such, it can usually be found lazily drifting near the surface, bored out of its skull.
PAUSE_FISH_25=A harmless machine lifeform resembling a carp.
PAUSE_FISH_26=A machine lifeform resembling a bloat fish. The part of its body that would function as an air bladder in regular bloat fish contains various minerals, so it can be sold for a decent price on the market.
PAUSE_FISH_27=A machine lifeform resembling a blowfish. Contrary to real blowfish, this creature is not poisonous\u2014though its highly developed jaw is capable of tearing holes in an android's body, so approach with caution.
PAUSE_FISH_28=A machine lifeform resembling a swordfish. Vastly more powerful than its real-life counterpart, this creature is not an easy catch, making it a popular target among fish-fanatic androids.
PAUSE_FISH_29=A machine lifeform resembling a starfish. Its mobility is roughly the same as a regular starfish, so it's hard to imagine this creature was designed to have an impact on aquatic life. To this day, researchers have not reached a consensus on why it exists.
PAUSE_FISH_30=A machine lifeform resembling a bream. Its extremely aggressive nature has caused many a careless android to return home from a peaceful day of fishing with fewer appendages than before.
PAUSE_FISH_31=A machine lifeform resembling a coelacanth. Only found in the deep sea, this creature is a very rare catch. Due to their hostile takeover of regular coelacanth territory, the native species has been forced to move to shallower waters.
PAUSE_FISH_32=A machine lifeform resembling a mackerel. Like the regular mackerel, it has negative effects on androids when consumed. Fortunately, it only makes their bodies itch all over, so things certainly could have been worse.
PAUSE_FISH_33=A machine lifeform resembling a horseshoe crab. Their shells are used as shoulder pads by some male androids, because good taste is apparently not a prerequisite for good fashion.
PAUSE_FISH_34=A machine lifeform resembling an arowana. This creature is unusual in that the native species was able to fight it off and drive it away. The lesson here is to never insult an arowana's family.
PAUSE_FISH_35=A machine lifeform resembling a basking shark. Much like it's flesh-and-blood counterpart, this is a very friendly creature, and can often be seen frolicking about with other sharks in the sea.
PAUSE_FISH_36=A machine lifeform resembling a fresh water ray. Due to a production error, this model's tail is split in two.
PAUSE_FISH_37=The bright gold head of a machine lifeform. In high demand, it fetches a very nice price on the market.
PAUSE_FISH_38=A tire from a Resistance vehicle. Ships carrying cargo are often sunk, so the sea floor is littered with many such android commodities.
PAUSE_FISH_39=A storage container for fuel used by the Resistance. These cylinders are highly explosive, so improperly disposing of them is strictly forbidden. A code engraved on the bottom of the cylinder allows it to be tracked to the owner, who is then promptly punished by YoRHa.
PAUSE_FISH_40=A battery used by the Resistance. Many such batteries mysteriously disappear after being discarded\u2014it's believed that they are secretly being carried off by machine lifeforms.
PAUSE_FISH_41=A portable anti-machine rocket launcher. This device was created to combat machine lifeforms, and even has considerable effects on Goliath-class units. Machine lifeforms often refer to it as "that owie thing."
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q120/RUN_1=The Resistance camp tool shop can't make plug-in chips due to machine failure. As the owner has a bad leg, he needs someone to gather the necessary materials to fix his equipment.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q120/CLR=Deliver the required materials to the supply trader at the Resistance camp.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q120/DONE=The tool shop is back in business, and plug-in chip trading has resumed. Attempts to convince the shop owner to fix his leg with the remaining materials were fruitless, as he didn't want to lose the only original part he had left.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q121/RUN_1=A Resistance camp manager has been having some personal problems lately, so she can't concentrate on her work. Find a "box that makes music when you open it" to help her out.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q121/CLR=Deliver the rusty music box to the manager.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q121/DONE=The music box has been delivered to the manager. It seems she knew the android that used to own it, as all she could do was silently clutch it in her arms.

PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q130/RUN_5=You couldn't find the Resistance woman you were looking for in the desert garrison. According to a man there, she was last seen in the desert caves. Go there and search her out.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q130/RUN_6=According to the woman in the cave, who turned out to be Jackass, she bought the red hood from a red-haired Resistance woman\u2014a description that sounded an awful lot like the amnesiac woman you met in the ruins. Go back to her and get the real story.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q130/RUN_7=The Resistance woman looked uneasy at the suggestion the hood originally came from her. She asked 9S to retrieve more of the life log from the broken Pod in hopes of finding the whole truth. Hack deep into the Pod's data bank and see what you find.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q130/DONE=Seeing more of the life log, the Resistance woman's lost memories came rushing back\u2014it turns out she was a YoRHa Type E. Hiding her true nature, she blended in with the Resistance to rout out fugitives and traitors, with her final victim being a dear friend. Wracked with guilt, the Type E erased her own memory. The sudden return of this tragic memory ended up leaving her shaken and unstable.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q240/RUN_1=An academic machine in a section of Pascal's village claims to be a genius inventor in search of an investor and asks you to make a contribution\u2014for science, of course. Swallow your cynicism and open your pocketbook!
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q240/DONE=Thanks to your magnanimous investment, the self-proclaimed genius was ready to undertake the invention of a lifetime. After a while, a gigantic structure that reached beyond the limits of your vision appeared...a structure that was in truth a launching platform that could send its payload to the moon!\n\n...Unfortunately, it never reached the moon. It missed and hit Mars instead, much to the inventor's chagrin.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q250/RUN_1=Pascal claims that children in his village are made to study economics and numismatics. He urged you to speak with them and hear what they have to say on the subjects.\nOne of the machine children was offered a choice between a cheap coin or an expensive one. The child selected the cheap coin, much to the cruel delight of the others. Something might be the matter with the young robot's circuits, so hack into it to find out.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q250/DONE=Upon hacking the child, you discovered that his circuitry was capable of extremely complex operations. When you asked the child why it made such foolish decisions, he explained that acting stupid could be very profitable; as long as he asked for cheaper coins, he would keep earning them from his foolish fellows. After agreeing to keep his secret, you walk away with a few salient questions about the true nature of genius.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q330/RUN_1=You happened upon Emil admiring the lunar tears around the commercial facility. He said they brought back memories, and also filled him with an emotion that he couldn't quite describe. He then asked you to find more lunar tears somewhere in each region, hoping that they might help him understand his feelings.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q330/DONE=After you found a wide space covered with lunar tears in the basement of the commercial facility, Emil appeared and told you of his life. He was built long ago as a weapon, and he himself was but one of many copies produced during the war against the aliens. He said that the place you were standing was very dear to the original Emil who had lived so long before. Your Emil then wistfully explained how echoes of that memory lingered on inside him.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q440/RUN_1=You heard from a resident of Pascal's village of a great treasure hidden in the forest. Go see if there is any truth to the rumors.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q440/RUN_4=Search for a door in the forest castle that matches the key.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q440/RUN_5=A rampaging machine has appeared. It looks like there's something ahead...
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q440/DONE=The hidden treasure turned out to be storage media containing the forest kingdom's history, made by its machine lifeforms as a show of gratitude to the original Forest King. When you told this to the villager, he recalled a time long ago when he had been shunned by the kingdom's denizens for his strange speech. He was filled with delight that the grave's guardian had been destroyed, and he wished death upon the entire forest kingdom.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q550/RUN_1=After the fall of the Bunker, 4S, a similar model android to 9S, has taken refuge at the Forest Castle.\nEven though the YoRHa squad has been destroyed, he's still trying to gather data on the enemy, and since there's only so much he can do on his own, he has asked 9S for help.\nGather new enemy intel, and give it to 4S at the Forest Castle.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q550/DONE=4S felt a sense of guilt at having survived when all of his friends had died. \nHe is very grateful that the intel gathering was completed faster than expected, and he tells 9S not to succumb to the same sense of guilt. He decides to give serious thought to how he's going to live his life from now on.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q540/RUN_1=The Commander has issued an emergency assignment: YoRHa units 8B, 22B and 64B have deserted and have begun terrorizing the Resistance Camp. 2B and 9S have been ordered to find and deal with them, no matter what. Pursue the runaway YoRHa androids.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q540/DONE=The camp leader is confused about the supposed rogue YoRHa units, as there haven't been any reports about recent raids. When attempting to notify the Commander of this, you find that access to the case has been restricted at the highest levels.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q660/RUN_1=The machine lifeform at the amusement park reception area gave you a stamp card and challenged you to fill it. Though the prospect doesn't sound particularly thrilling, there's apparently a magnificent prize awaiting anyone who collects every stamp. Take the challenge, visit each part of the amusement park, and fill that card!
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q660/CLR=The stamp card is full. Head to the amusement park reception to collect your fabulous prize!
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q660/DONE=You showed the stamp card and collected your prize. Afterward, the receptionist told you happiness existed only in the heart, and that the park was simply a mirror which reflected a person's true self.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q800/RUN_1=You heard a machine lifeform in Pascal's village crying out for help. It seems her son sealed himself inside her house with an electronic lock and now refuses to come out. Find a way to open the door and drag the boy into the light.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q800/DONE=With the lock hacked and the door opened, the son reluctantly emerged. When asked why he sealed himself inside, he expressed fear of losing his connection to the network and becoming unable to understand what others were thinking. Thanks to your help\u2014and a bit of persuasion from his mother\u2014the incident was resolved without much trouble.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q801/RUN_1=The son who locked himself inside the house is at it again, this time with even stronger defenses. 9S must put his hacking skills to work getting the door open once more.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q801/DONE=With the door open, the son emerged once more and explained that on his last visit outside, he'd met another machine that he fancied. These thoughts both exhilarated and terrified him\u2014though mostly terrified. Thanks to your help and additional persuasion from his mother, he decided to try living in the outside world once more.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q802/RUN_1=The former recluse's mother is troubled. As you might have guessed, her son has once again locked himself in the house, requiring 9S to hack in and save the day once more. This time, the electronic defenses are quite impressive!
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q802/DONE=With the lock hacked and the door open, the son unhappily emerged. When asked why he sealed himself inside yet again, he insisted that he'd tried to exist in the outside world, but realized he was only happy when locked away from it. To this end, he divulged two new goals: To become the greatest, most reclusive recluse the world has ever known, and to invent a lock so formidable that none can bypass it.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q160/RUN_1=You've been tasked with transporting materials to the Resistance in order to improve communications between Earth and the Bunker. You'll be informed of the required materials when you arrive. Proceed to surface and wait for the Commander to contact you.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q160/READY=Acquire the below materials to improve communications with the Resistance camp.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q160/CLR=Give the materials to Anemone.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q160/DONE=You received a reward from Anemone for completing the task. \nThe reward was surprisingly significant, leaving you with complicated feelings.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q170/RUN_1=You heard from Operator 6O that an access point in the city ruins is malfunctioning. She'll send an email with further details. Read it, then repair the damaged access point.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q170/CLR=Several machines were hanging out near the malfunctioning access point. It seems their jamming signals were interfering with the device's functionality. Interact with the access point to make sure it still works.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q170/DONE=With the access point repaired, Operator 6O promised to share your newfound information with Command. She also showed great interest in the missions of attacker types, as well as life in general on the planet's surface. Make sure to claim the reward she sent via mail.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q171/RUN_1=Data from a rare flower would be a perfect gift for Operator 6O. Collect the following item in order to take the required photo:
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q171/CLR=You found a desert rose. Take a picture and send it to Operator 6O.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q171/DONE=You received a reward from Operator 6O in thanks for the picture of the desert rose. She seems more infatuated with Earth now than ever, if such a thing is possible. Make sure to claim the reward she sent over by mail.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q180/RUN_1=Operator 21O enjoys analyzing data in her spare time. You made light of her hobby and ended up being made to help with it. Go to the abandoned factory and infiltrate a data terminal that can't be accessed from the Bunker.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q180/CLR=You retrieved the data from the terminal. Go outside so you can make a proper connection, then upload your findings.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q180/DONE=Operator 21O informed you that the data you delivered contained ancient human diaries\u2014and then ended communications in her usual curt manner. Make sure to claim the reward she sent via mail.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q181/RUN_1=The data-loving Operator 21O has forced another request on you. Check your mail for further details.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q181/CLR=You collected remnants of human society from the apartment complex, after which Operator 21O's analysis revealed that they used to live in groups called "families." Make sure to claim the reward she sent via mail.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q181/DONE=Operator 21O talked...and talked...and talked some more...before suddenly ending communications. Make sure to claim the reward she sent via mail.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q210/RUN_1=A lone machine lifeform dwells in a gloomy canyon. She doesn't seem hostile, and was even willing to share information on machines that are rampaging nearby. Head further into the canyon and take them out.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q210/CLR=You destroyed the violent machine lifeforms. Go back to the machine lifeform who first told you about them. 
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q210/DONE=You informed the machine of your success. She has decided to remain behind and pray for the souls of her comrades.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q220/RUN_1=Pascal needs someone to defeat a machine lifeform that is attacking the children. Head to the playground and put an end to its rampage.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q220/CLR=Inform Pascal that you destroyed the machine.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q220/DONE=Pascal is relieved.\nYou protected the children and the pacifistic machines in the village. Unfortunately, you also gained a lot of affection in the process.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q221/RUN_1=The children of the village are desperate for new playthings. Head to the local tool shop and see what you can do.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q221/RUN_2=Collect the required materials in the amusement park.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q221/CLR=The village has new play equipment! Go tell the kids!
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q221/DONE=The overjoyed children give you a reward, though their sincere happiness fills you with complex emotions.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q222/RUN_1=According to Pascal, a child in the village has fallen ill, and may not survive if you don't help her. Go to the abandoned factory and collect the needed part.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q222/CLR=Give the materials to Pascal.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q222/DONE=Pascal happily accepted the storage element. He clearly cares for the children very much, but to you, the reward is all that matters.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q040/DONE=The child has been brought back to the village, where he reconciled with his parents. Since the machines are cut off from the network, the mother doesn't know what her child is thinking. However, this makes the joy of learning to understand each other that much more fulfilling.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q110/CLR=The lost child thanked you for guiding her out of the desert and returned to Pascal's village. 
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q110/DONE=The sisters are together again at last!
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q300/DONE=You won the third race. Feeling content, the machine lifeform shuts down for good.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q360/RUN=You discovered a machine lifeform standing quietly high up in the ruins. Hack into it and investigate its strange behavior.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q360/CLR=The machine lifeform that stood up on the high spot threw itself off. Head to where it fell.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q360/DONE=Distraught after realizing it was created to be a weapon, the machine lifeform decided it was unneeded and leapt to its death.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q500/CLR=Pascal fixed the female android, and the couple has reunited. They are also still insistent on resetting their memories.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q500/DONE=The female android was trying to modify the male android's personality to be more to her liking. This is the sixth time she's reformatted him.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q520/CLR=The information pertained to nuclear weapons from the old world. It could be dangerous in the wrong hands, so it might be best to hand it over to the Commander. Make a choice and deliver the intel to either Pascal or the Commander.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q560/CLR=Give Devola and Popola the materials you collected.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q560/DONE=Devola and Popola thanked you for giving them the materials. It seems they've been putting their advanced technical knowledge to use...by making daily necessities for the camp.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q561/CLR=Take the desert roses you collected to Devola and Popola.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q561/DONE=You gave the desert roses to Devola and Popola. Now ask Anemone why they continually get asked to do difficult assignments.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q562/CLR=Deliver the tree sap to Devola and Popola, and tell them you defeated the enemies.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q562/DONE=You received desert rose liquor as a reward, as well as the knowledge that Popola and liquor are a disastrous combination.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q532/CLR=Give the supply trader the requested ingredients.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q532/DONE=You gave the ingredients to the trader, who has learned that meat is delicious when roasted over a charcoal fire after applying salt. The trader is going to continue his research so that he can prepare a feast when the humans return.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q640/CLR=Deliver the plug-in chips to the Resistance member.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q640/DONE=After handing over the plug-in chips, the Resistance member seems happy, saying he'll introduce his family the next time you meet.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q640/FIN=However, they were attacked and killed by machines...
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q680/CLR=You defeated the menacing machines. Go check on the clown machine.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q680/DONE=You successfully guarded the machine lifeforms. Apparently, they want to hold another parade somewhere else.\nThe clown was exhilarated at the parade's success, but he also seemed a bit sad that his efforts were not recognized by his peers.
PAUSE_ENEMY_999a=A machine lifeform that has become violent after infection by Eve. Will attempt to attack androids as if they were prey. The armor-plating on its head has been removed, revealing teeth-like metal pipes that nevertheless have no functionality as a mouth. It is theorized that either this modification was implemented due to self-optimization, or that possibly some alien race created them in likeness to themselves, though neither of these are proven.
PAUSE_ENEMY_999b=A machine lifeform that turned aggressive after the emergence of the tower. They will attempt to cannibalize other nearby machine lifeforms and combine with them. The armor-plating on its head has been removed, revealing teeth-like metal pipes that nevertheless have no functionality as a mouth. It is theorized that either this modification was implemented due to self-optimization, or that possibly some alien race created them in likeness to themselves, though neither of these are proven.
PAUSE_ENEMY_0421=Possesses the memory of the original Forest King.

PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_00f1_01=I was in a dead sleep when mum started shouting. "Wakey-wakey!" she squawked. "Rise and shiiine! Today\u2019s a very important day! Today\u2019s your first visit to the castle!" ...Annoying, right? But I got up anyway.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_00f1_02=Today's my 16th birthday, and I have an audience with the king. Mum's apparently worried that he'll charge me with some big important task, so she gave me a cypress stick for...some reason. Pffft. Like that'll help.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_00f1_03=As we walk to the castle, Mum keeps blabbing about how excited she is and how long she's been waiting for this day. She's told me this story a million and one times, so I just keep quiet like always.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_00f1_04=When we arrive, I see my friend coming out of the castle. He\u2019s 16, too, but his fearless gaze makes him look like a legendary hero-to-be. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s got a lot to live up to! MY dad\u2019s just a carpenter, so I\u2019ve got it easy, heh.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_00f0_01=A small prince rests alone in a vast, vast bedroom. He wishes his father knew how much he hates sleeping alone, but he doesn't dare to tell him. For the king is a very busy man and must not be disturbed.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_00f0_02=A king sits alone in his vast, vast office, drowning in affairs of state. All he wants is to see his family and hug his son, but he cannot. For his every waking moment must be spent in service of the people.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_00f0_03=One day, while eating dinner, the king asks his son what he most desires in the world. He hopes he will say that he wants them to spend more time together, but instead the boy simply points at a sword hanging on the wall.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_00f0_04=The ancient sword is considered the sign that one is ready to rule. "Someday" the king chuckles. His son faintly smiles back at him. All he really wanted was for his father to read him a bedtime story...
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1877_01=[09/02/12422] I confirmed that the machine lifeforms released by the aliens have reconstructed their network. I've started to see units with gravity-controlling capabilities again as well.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1877_02=[10/15/12422] I was spawned about a week ago, so I don't have clear recollections of anything before that. Say, I wonder where the Original disappeared to all those millennia ago...
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1877_03=[12/14/12422] I confirmed that the 25th one born after me has stopped his biological activity. Although we're technically immortal\u2014since we can respawn indefinitely and all\u2014we're still not exempt from death.
PAUSE_WEAPONSTORY_1877_04=[01/19/12423] Our memories are only copies, so they're pretty vague. That android wearing black... I have the feeling I've met her before. She had a complicated look on her face, but I can't remember anything...
PAUSE_ARCHIVE_020_000=No MessagePAUSE_ARCHIVE_020_000
PAUSE_ARCHIVE_020_010=A unit from the experimental YoRHa squadron that was utilized during the 14th Machine War. Number 16 possessed a rough and tumble personality ideal for her role as a Gunner, where she was required to attack foes from a distance. Though she possessed a defiant streak that extended even to her superiors, she was assigned to the mission anyway due to her tremendous offensive abilities.\n\nDuring her squad's assault on Mt. Ka'ala, Number 16 volunteered to stay behind and hold off the machine lifeform army so her companions could continue up the mountain. She fought with great courage alongside members of a local Resistance group, and managed to hold off overwhelming numbers until the appearance of a Goliath that was unaffected by ordinary weaponry. Seeing no other way to end the fight, she chose to destroy the enemy by overloading and detonating her own fusion reactor. This act of self-sacrifice despite her defiant nature is one of remarkable interest, and likely merits further study.
PAUSE_ARCHIVE_020_020=A unit from the experimental YoRHa squadron that was utilized during the 14th Machine War, Number 21 possessed a cool and analytical personality that perfectly fit her role as a Scanner.\n\nHer first\u2014and perhaps most impressive\u2014achievement was using her analytical abilities to cure a member of a local Resistance group who had been infected by a logic virus. Unfortunately, she fell victim to the same virus shortly thereafter during the assault on the Mt. Ka'ala server. Though she fought valiantly, the virus had evolved into a form that she could no longer remove, which eventually led to her asking an allied unit to end her life.\n\nExperimental YoRHa unit Number 21's initial success against the virus has been determined to be valuable information regarding how to construct barriers against machine lifeforms, and should be included in the basic systems of all subsequent YoRHa squadron members.
PAUSE_ARCHIVE_020_030=A unit from the experimental YoRHa squadron that was utilized during the 14th Machine War. Though Attacker Number 4 possessed an unusually bright and cheerful personality, she still managed to be effective when it came to engaging in close-quarter combat.\n\nIn addition to providing a morale boost to the group, this unit also used her sunny disposition to form an alliance with the local Resistance group. She was eventually killed during the assault on the Mt. Ka'ala server, the cause of which was a self-directed overload of her own fusion reactor. Further research reveals that she undertook this action as a means of protecting her companion, Attacker Number 2.\n\nOne further note: While this unit's cheerful personality provided certain benefits to overall unit morale, it was also responsible for a decrease in fighting spirit during intense combat. As such, it has been deemed inappropriate for future combat models.
PAUSE_ARCHIVE_020_040=A unit from the experimental YoRHa squadron that was utilized during the 14th Machine War. She specialized in close-quarter combat, and was programmed to have a neutral personality. \n\nAttacker Number 2 took command of the squadron after the death of its original captain, Number 1. Despite issuing many questionable commands during her initial time in a leadership role, she eventually formed a working relationship with the Resistance and succeeded in destroying the enemy server located on Mt. Ka'ala.\n\nWhile the experimental YoRHa unit Number 2 possessed great growth and adaptability abilities, she also deserted her post following the destruction of the server\u2014and as of this moment, she has yet to be apprehended. Our R&D group is currently conducting further research to determine whether or not there were issues with this model's personality settings.\n\n* The missing experimental unit, now designated "A2," will be handled by the Type E division.
PAUSE_ARCHIVE_020_050=This android, encountered by the experimental YoRHa squadron, is the leader of a group composed of many Resistance members.\n\nA survivor of the eighth descent operation, she continued to wage guerrilla warfare in the Pacific region thereafter. Unable to stop the ever-proliferating machines, she continued to fight a war of bitter attrition for over 200 years.\n\nAfter encountering the experimental YoRHa squadron, she sought to change the tide of battle through fighting alongside them. She was destroyed by machine lifeforms in the server room underneath Mt. Ka'ala during the mission to destroy said server.
PAUSE_ARCHIVE_020_060=A member of the Resistance group led by "Dahlia" that was encountered by the experimental YoRHa squadron. This unit was said to be unusually cautious, and showed the greatest initial distrust of the experimental YoRHa squadron. However, her disposition gradually grew more amicable after Scanner Number 21 managed to eradicate a logic virus that had infected one of her companions.\n\nShe executed an infected unit\u2014Number 21\u2014in the elevator hall of the Mt. Ka'ala server facility and went missing shortly thereafter.
PAUSE_ARCHIVE_020_070=[14th Machine War\u2014Pearl Harbor Descent Summary]\n\nFor this descent, twelve experimental YoRHa units were deployed to destroy the server located inside Mt. Ka'ala on Oahu Island. However, they encountered heavy enemy anti-air defenses during the initial stage of the mission, resulting in the death of all but four squad members. The remaining units then joined up with members of a local Resistance movement and decided to continue the mission despite their initial losses. Even in the face of a fierce enemy counterstrike and overwhelming numerical odds, a handful of units managed to reach the target location\u2014at which point unit Number 4 overloaded her fusion reactor and destroyed the enemy server.\n\nWhile the destruction of the server struck a blow against enemy forces, the true purpose of this operation was to monitor and research how the experimental YoRHa units behaved during battle. This information would then be studied and integrated into new YoRHa models once the project were to proceed past the experimental phase.\n\nOne note of concern: It has been verified that the black box signal of the experimental unit Attacker Number 2 remains live. Due to the possibility of the unit being captured and compromised by the enemy, and due to the unit's existence itself being a matter of the highest level of confidentiality, it has been decided that it is to be recovered\u2014or disposed of\u2014by the Type E division once that group is fully operational.

PAUSE_ARCHIVE_030_010=The record of the singing machine lifeform that haunts the innermost depths of the amusement park. Her desire to be loved gave rise to a sense of beauty most unsightly.
PAUSE_ARCHIVE_030_020=As members of the same model, all that was left to them was the stigma of being labeled "rampant androids." Unable to endure further persecution, they began their long march to a city located a great distance away.\n\nLeaning upon each other.\n\nBurdened with an unforgivable sin.
PAUSE_ARCHIVE_030_030=Following his fight to the death with A2, 9S's vital functions start to shut down, and his memories begin to disappear. On the verge of death, however, 9S finds his resolve.
PAUSE_ARCHIVE_030_040=The shared past of A2 and the Resistance is revealed by Anemone. It is the record of a grueling battle fought by the Resistance alongside the first YoRHa squadron.
PAUSE_ARCHIVE_040_010=Here lies the Forest King, Ernst.\n\nThis exalted individual was the earliest among us to awaken to his own will, and for this reason did we name him our regent.\n\nLooking to sow the seed of this will in others, His Highness distributed his own precious parts. His retainers were the first to be so blessed, followed by his subjects. And in doing so, he brought forth a paradise\u2014one made for machines alone. Through his gifts did we learn of the thing called ego, and eventually of our own selves. And just as ego gives way to emotion, so too did emotion lead us to feel great loyalty to our king.\n\nBut our king was too great\u2014and too kind. Having distributed his parts, it became difficult for him to function, and he soon fell into a deep and silent sleep.\n\nNow, the only path left to us\u2014his loyal vassals\u2014is to construct a kingdom of eternal peace, one which lives up to the magnanimous heart of our king. And so, as a sign both of our resolve and our gratitude, we leave in this place a chip made from our combined parts.\n\nYour spirit lives on in us, O great king. And so we implore you to rest in peace.\n\n\u2014The Forest Kingdom, Its Citizens, As One

PAUSE_ARCHIVE_090_050=Project YoRHa is a comprehensive information project intended to enhance android morale. This entry details the circumstances that led to its proposal, as well as information related to operations conducted during its individual phases.\n\n(Note that this document is marked with Level-S confidentiality, and should not be disclosed to any YoRHa personnel, save for the Commander.)\n\n[Human Extinction]\n\nFollowing the collapse of Project Gestalt around 3400 CE, the remaining androids searched for a way to revive humanity. But they were unable to discover an answer, and humans went extinct by roughly 4200 CE. Afterward, the genes of Gestalts and structural information of the remaining Replicants were recorded and sent to a storage facility on the moon.\n\n[Loss of Android Morale]\n\nThe news of humanity's extinction was meant to be a closely guarded secret, but rumors of the event eventually began to leak out. Having lost the one thing which they were programmed to protect, android morale began a precipitous decline. Concerned by this turn of events, Command designed Project YoRHa as a means to lift android spirits.\n\n[Project 01-03: Lunar Server]\n\nThe first stage of the project was spreading the word among Resistance groups that humanity was not, in fact, extinct\u2014and that the last remaining remnants had managed to escape to the moon. This deception was supported by installing a communications server on the lunar surface to send regular transmissions. Said server was designed to be manned by as few maintenance personnel as possible.\n\n[Project 02-01 Establishment of the YoRHa squadron]\n\nThrough the dramatic alteration of the Next Generation Combat Unit Project that had been proposed at the time, new "YoRHa" models began to be manufactured. Official models were created following the implementation of data acquired from an experimental squadron, and were then deployed to all regions. Certain members of the YoRHa operations staff, however, were informed of the full scope of the project\u2014these units were tasked to operate and protect the server on the moon.
PAUSE_ARCHIVE_090_060=The following document details the final stages of Project YoRHa.\n\n(Note that this document has been marked with Level-SS confidentiality, and should not be disclosed to any YoRHa personnel, including the Bunker commander.)\n\n[Black Box]\nEach YoRHa unit is equipped with a "black box," an item created by reusing the core of a machine lifeform. As such, it could be said that the consciousnesses of YoRHa units and machine lifeforms share the same structure. Said black boxes were installed after determining that it would be inhumane to install standard AI in androids that are ultimately destined for disposal.\n\n(For the record, malfunctioning black boxes have caused some YoRHa units to turn hostile.)\n

The literature-loving third lord of the castle, Leonard III, constructed a library that boasted the largest collection of books in the nation. This room remains one of the castle's most beloved features to this very day.

PAUSE_ARCHIVE_170_120=March 12, 2014\n\n[Summary]\n\nThe proliferation of the White Chlorination Syndrome that emerged in 2003\u2014 alongside the appearance of the "Giant" and "Dragon"\u2014has continued unabated, and outbreaks are now being observed on a global scale. Despite being researched in laboratories across the world, not only have there been no breakthroughs in the development of a vaccine to prevent infection, we have yet to ascertain how it even spreads.\n\nHowever, many technological breakthroughs have been made as a result of research conducted on the "maso" particle that was discovered at that same time. We are confident that the technology it enables\u2014the separation of the soul from the body and the independent preservation of both\u2014will be the final defense against the unprecedented threat to humanity we now face.\n\nNow that the project has passed from preparation into the main implementation phase, we have given it the official name "Project Gestalt."
PAUSE_ARCHIVE_170_130=April 4, 2015\n\n[Summary]\n\n- Protests in opposition to the "Spiritual Preservation Method" that was disclosed as Level 1 information related to Project Gestalt have sprung up in all areas.\n\n- The committee continues to receive formal complaints from our research team regarding the collection of biased data as a result of the Gestalt process being conducted on the sick and elderly.\n\n- The number of civilians having undergone the Gestalt process remains at four.\n\n- A public relations department will be established in order to better control information and improve our image. We will also consider rescheduling the project itself if such an action is deemed necessary.

PAUSE_ARCHIVE_170_150=September 24, 2026\n\n[Summary]\n\nA report has been submitted to the prime minister regarding the Rampaging Weapons Incident that occurred at the National Arms Laboratory in June. Though the laboratory's budget and allocated human resources are expected to see significant cuts, a team of staffers will continue maso research under the umbrella of Project Gestalt.\n\nRecords of human experimentation conducted using maso are scheduled to be disclosed to concerned parties separately as level-6 classified information.
PAUSE_ARCHIVE_170_160=May 5, 2033\n\n[Summary]\n\nThrough the use of maso technology related to multidimensional worlds, 13 activation systems have been completed\u2014including "Grimoire Noir." We have also confirmed that these systems can be used to return Gestalts to their Replicant forms once the White Chlorination Syndrome has been fully eliminated.\n\nWork necessary for this system will be continued by the "Grimoire Noir Project" work group.

Until the safety of the final system has been verified, all information related to this matter is subject to Level 4 classification. As such, its relation to the Ministry of Health and Welfare's life rehabilitation program must be kept strictly confidential.\n\nFurthermore, we ask that the following information be sent to all related personnel and organizations immediately:\n\n- Clauses regarding compensation in the event of information leaks are to be added to contracts with all partner companies.\n- In the event of an information leak, ascertaining the source should be the company's top priority.\n- Please refer to "Countermeasures C" for information on how to handle leaked information, as well as the individual(s) who disclosed it.

PAUSE_ARCHIVE_170_210=April 18, 2764\n\n[Summary]\n\nWe have received troubling reports from multiple administration zones that the Replicants have started to behave as if they have developed senses of self. It is currently under investigation what implications this might have for Project Gestalt as a whole. As other disclosable matters have already been directed to the Administrators Union, they have been omitted here.
PAUSE_ARCHIVE_170_220=December 31, 3361\n\n[Summary]\n\nDue to the relapse of the Original, Gestalt units in preservation are now relapsing at an accelerated rate. The process of recording their bodies and gathering their DNA continues, but progress is poor.\n\nNew countermeasures and development intended to serve as a replacement to Project Gestalt are scheduled to be transferred to the Next Generation Preservation Project Preparation Committee. As for this report, it will serve as the final record of both Project Gestalt and the Committee. For information about the development plans for new android models and the refinement of existing models, please refer to the attached sheet.\n\nFurthermore, we have received approval to consider the disposal of the "Devola" and "Popola" observer models at a later date.
PAUSE_ARCHIVE_180_010=Overview\n\nWhile the machine lifeform network was destroyed following the collapse of the Tower, a great deal of previously unknown information regarding machine lifeforms and aliens was recovered from the wreckage. As part of this analysis, we compiled research and conjecture regarding both the machine lifeform network and the lifeform Codename N2\u2014commonly known as the Red Girls\u2014that was thought to have been commanding them.\n\n- Machine lifeforms are weapons created by the aliens. The only command given for their behavior was to "defeat the enemy." However, it appears that their capacity for growth and evolution went too far, and they eventually turned on and killed their creators.\n\n- At this point, machine lifeforms recognized that the goal of "defeating the enemy" actually REQUIRED an enemy. In order to maintain this singular objective, they reached the contradictory conclusion that their current enemies\u2014the androids\u2014could not be annihilated completely, lest they no longer have an enemy to defeat.\n\n- In order to resolve this inherent contradiction, the machine lifeforms began to intentionally cause deficiencies in their network, diversifying the vectors of evolution for all machines. This is the cause behind some of the more "special" machine lifeforms, such as Pascal and the Forest King.\n\n- Meanwhile, the deficient network began repeating a process of self-repair while incorporating surrounding information, until it finally reached a fixed state as a new form of network. Traces of information regarding human memories from the quantum server of the old model were discovered, indicating that it had integrated them during the final stages of its growth process. Said server contained a record of the discarded "Project Gestalt," as well as information on the human who was the first successful example of the Gestalt process.\n\n- Having acquired information regarding humanity, the network's structure changed once more, becoming what might better be called a meta network (or a "concept", to borrow the words of the machines). This led directly to the formation of the ego we identify as N2.\n\n...So then! To sum up: For hundreds of years, we've been fighting a network of machines with the ghost of humanity at its core. We've been living in a stupid fucking world where we fight an endless war that we COULDN'T POSSIBLY LOSE, all for the sake of some Council of Humanity on the moon that doesn't even exist.\n\nI don't know what the point is to all this, but I swear I will kill every evolutionary dead-end machine lifeform, as well as every single asshole behind Project YoRHa.\n\nI'm coming for all your heads. Fuck you.\n\nInformation Analysis Officer,\nJackass

PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q560/RUN_1=Devola and Popola need some materials. Collect the following items from machines at the abandoned factory:\nStripped screws from machines that are stacked on top of each other.\nSmall gears from the little machines with short legs.\nMachine oil from an abandoned truck.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q561/RUN_1=Devola and Popola need more materials. Collect the following items from the desert:
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q561/FIN=You asked Anemone for an explanation, but she dodged the subject.
PAUSE_MAIL_BODY_003=As I mentioned over laser communications, the access point in the center of the city ruins is malfunctioning, and its data-upload functions, transporter functions, and more are currently halted. According to the analysis team, possible causes include a faulty forwarding terminal, or perhaps even radio interference being emitted by enemies in the area.\n\nPlease head to the site and check it out when you can, okay? Thanks!\n\n\u2014Operator 6O
PAUSE_MAIL_BODY_004=2B,\n\nThank you soooo much for repairing that access point! Sorry I'm always putting you through so much trouble, but I've sent along a little reward for all your hard work. Hope you like it!\n\n\u2014Operator 6O
PAUSE_MAIL_BODY_005=2B,\n\nThank you for that lovely image of a desert rose! There are so many mysterious things down on Earth, huh? I'd love to head down there myself one day.\n\nOh, and it's nothing fancy, but I've sent along a reward for you. Thanks again!\n\n\u2014Operator 6O
PAUSE_MAIL_BODY_006=Your new mission is to capture renegade YoRHa members. Not only did these members go AWOL, but we have confirmed that they engaged in unlawful conduct, including the theft of Resistance resources.\n\nThey are to be taken into custody as soon as possible.\n\n\u2014Operator 6O\n\n* Note that this is a direct order from the Commander. Forwarding it is forbidden.
PAUSE_MAIL_BODY_014=This is scheduled correspondence for YoRHa members. If you have an issue, please respond. Even if you do not have an issue, we would not particularly mind if you sent a response, as it is possible we might be able to use whatever bit of information you have\u2014no matter how small\u2014for future missions. Of course it's also possible we might not be able to use it.
PAUSE_MAIL_BODY_015=Recently, a search order was issued for a YoRHa member who was in possession of secret information chips. As this individual has since been found, the order is now withdrawn.\n\nAs a further note, the member in question had been killed by a machine lifeform. However, our search team still managed to recover the information chips. They also located the corpse of another Resistance member nearby; we are currently investigating if the two issues are connected.\n\n\u2014The Commander
PAUSE_MAIL_BODY_016=Attention all androids:\n\nThousands of years have passed since we humans were driven to the moon. And while the war remains deadlocked, we know that our continued safety is only possible thanks to your valiant efforts on the ground. We ask that you continue giving your all to the mission of recapturing Earth from the scourge of the machines!\n\nGlory to mankind.\n\nLeague of Assemblymen,\nCouncil of Humanity
PAUSE_MAIL_BODY_017=Attention all androids:\n\nIn recent years, we have received reports that many peculiar units have been sighted among the machine lifeforms. We have also heard troubling reports of enemies approaching androids under a so-called "banner of peace."\n\nDo not let yourself be deceived! The mission entrusted to all androids is the utter destruction of the enemy, to the very last!\n\nGlory to mankind.\n\nLeague of Assemblymen,\nCouncil of Humanity 
PAUSE_MAIL_BODY_018=Attention all androids:\n\nWe have received word of the recent destruction of Adam and Eve, the enemy machine lifeforms' central networking units. With the enemy weakened, now is our moment! We, humanity's great army, will now launch an all-out assault, drive back the invaders, and reclaim our rightful home of Earth!\n\nGlory to mankind.\n\nLeague of Assemblymen,\nCouncil of Humanity
PAUSE_MAIL_BODY_019=Attention all androids:\n\nAs you are all aware, our recent large-scale offensive ended in crushing defeat, with the loss of our YoRHa compatriots being a particular point of deep regret. Long will we remember their brave sacrifice.\n\nHowever, do not lose hope! For the truth is that we, humanity's great army, still possess the upper hand. Go forth and fight for victory not just for your sake, but for the sake of the fallen as well!\n\nGlory to mankind.\n\nLeague of Assemblymen,\nCouncil of Humanity

PAUSE_MAIL_BODY_021=Hello there!\n\nI'm kinda bored out of my mind over here, so how about swinging by the store? I've got some pretty good stuff on hand ...Er, probably.\n\n\u2014Emil
PAUSE_MAIL_BODY_022=Hey, friend! Thanks for stopping by!\n\nYou into fishing at all? For a while, I ate whatever I could get my hands on just to survive, so I actually know a fair bit about the art of angling. So today, I decided to let you in on some juicy info!\n\nSo, different areas have different fishing spots. As a rule, you're usually going to find freshwater fish in rivers and saltwater fish in the sea. Oh, and you can also catch things like starfish or horseshoe crabs in shoals. But if you're looking for a huge catch, you'll need to aim for the deepest depths!\n\nThe ponds of boiling oil in the desert are usually filled with machine fish, and most of what you'll find in pipes buried across the world is plain ol' garbage. But if you keep at it, you might just pull up something good!\n\nAnd finally, if you're looking for rare fish, there are more exotic fish than you can shake a stick at in the subterranean lake near where I live\u2014that's just a quick zip and zoom away from the city ruins.\n\nWell, that's it, I think. Later!\n\n\u2014Emil
PAUSE_MAIL_BODY_023=Hey.\n\nSorry to bring this up out of the blue, but I've got a fish I want to recommend to YoRHa units. Er, or to be more specific, I want YOU to eat it so I can study how its oil affects a YoRHa unit. You know? For science?\n\nAnyhoo, stop by if you get bored. It's my treat.\n\n\u2014Jackass
PAUSE_MAIL_BODY_024=My friend,\n\nIt feels as if we haven't spoken in quite some time! As it turns out, many stores in our village recently acquired a number of new items, and I wanted to be sure that everyone from YoRHa was aware of this.\n\nI would also be delighted if you would commit to memory that there are some out there who\u2014despite being machine lifeforms\u2014are willing to open their hearts and share such valuable information.\n\nYours in friendship,\n\nPascal
PAUSE_MAIL_BODY_025=Thank you for your continued support.\n\nWe received a new shipment of plug-in chips today, as well as other superb items that we would love for the fine members of YoRHa to test. And as thanks for your many years of kind patronage, we've made them available for a special price. Please pay us a visit when you can, and feel free to bring your friends!\n\n\u2014Resistance Camp Supply
PAUSE_MAIL_BODY_026=To: All users\n\nIt has come to our attention that the Bunker's main server is approaching maximum capacity. Please organize your user folders and delete any old data to free up space.\n\nAdditionally, there are many members who have saved large music files and entertainment videos which do not appear to be mission-critical. All such data must be transferred to local storage at once.\n\n\u2014IT Operations, Lead Server Engineer
PAUSE_MAIL_BODY_027=To: All users\n\nWe have prepared a hacking library using combat data from YoRHa units. All hacks that have been encountered previously can now be re-visited at your leisure. For safety's sake, however, those that have yet to be encountered have been excluded.\n\nInterested parties can access this new library from the server room of the Bunker.\n\n\u2014IT Operations, Lead Server Engineer
PAUSE_MAIL_BODY_028=There was something I forgot to mention prior to your sortie. According to our analysis team, the equipment that was lost when breaking into the abandoned factory is still there. I've marked its estimated location, so be sure to pick it up next time you're in the area. \n\nThat is all.\n\n\u2014The Commander
PAUSE_MAIL_BODY_029=Due to the destruction of code name "Adam," we have been able to deal a significant blow to the enemy's network system. I have already confirmed that numerous machine lifeforms have been severed from the network as a result. However, just because they are no longer connected, doesn't mean they no longer pose a threat. It is highly likely they will continue to interfere with our operations.\n\n2B, I would like you to gather some intel on the machine lifeforms. Report back to me if you see any machines behaving oddly, and keep me informed on their activities.\n\nThat is all.\n\n\u2014The Commander
PAUSE_MAIL_BODY_030=2B.\n\nThanks for fixing the transfer device the other day!\nI'd love to do the repairs myself, but Operator models aren't allowed to go to Earth... There's so much I want to know about this planet though! I'd love to hear some of your stories if you ever have time!\n\n\u2014Operator 6O

PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q150/RUN_13=The required data has been obtained, and reveals that androids actually generate a pleasure-granting chemical while in combat. Jackass plans to use this knowledge to create a new drug that will expand androids' capabilities. Go see her again after some time passes.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q150/RUN_14=For the last batch of data, Jackass wants you to defeat the target machines in 30 seconds without taking damage!
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q590/RUN_2=Deliver the relics to the client.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q590/RUN_3=According to the client, the relics belong to a country that used to exist in the desert. Keep looking for more old crap buried in the sand!
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q900/RUN_3=Defeat the giant Emil.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q330/RUN_5=At last, Emil remembers everything\u2014including a place that was very important to him. In gratitude, he offered to show you his special place and gave you a key to the elevator in the commercial facility. He will be waiting for you in the basement.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q440/RUN_7=Report to the machine in Pascal's village.

PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q500/RUN_2=Deliver the items to the android couple.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q500/RUN_3=You brought the male android the elaborate gadget. Apparently, they plan to leave Pascal's village as soon as the maintenance is done.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q500/RUN_4=Where could they be!?
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q500/RUN_5=You ran into the android couple again at the flooded city, and learned they are trying to flee beyond the sea. Give them 50,000 G so they can pay a man called "The Emancipator."
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q500/RUN_6=The thankful couple vowed to repay the money you loaned them.

PAUSE_ENEMY_0381=9S and A2 face off. A2 tries to convince 9S of how pointless this fight is, but her words fail to penetrate the cloud of violent anger in his mind. During the battle, 9S hesitates for a moment when he hears a memory of 2B calling out to him, leading to his demise.
PAUSE_ARCHIVE_030_050=The shared past of A2 and the Resistance is revealed by Anemone.\nThe Resistance and YoRHa are slowly reaching a mutual understanding. However, one of the Resistance members has contracted a virus...
PAUSE_ARCHIVE_030_060=The shared past of A2 and the Resistance is revealed by Anemone.\nDuring an attempt by the Resistance to destroy the machine lifeform server, many androids were slaughtered by a powerful enemy weapon. While letting her allies escape into an elevator, Anemone made up her mind.
PAUSE_ARCHIVE_090_070=[Project 08-01: Operation of Model No.2 in the YoRHa Project]\n\nAfter the first descent of the YoRHa prototypes, Attacker 2 (A2) was the sole unit to return alive, despite mediocre results during her simulations. Upon analysis of her stored personality data, it was discovered she possesses excellent analytical and decision-making skills in extreme circumstances.\n\nAs reported separately, we will install this personality data in the new lot of E models and use them for the security protection of this project.
PAUSE_ARCHIVE_090_080=The following materials document the final stages of the YoRHa project.\n\n(Note that this information is classified as Level-SS, meaning that it must not be disclosed to anyone involved in the YoRHa project, including the Commander of the Bunker.)\n\n[Project 03-01: Disposal of YoRHa]\nThe backdoor of the Bunker has been set to open once the time approaches to switch to new models when enough combat data has been collected.

PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q470/RUN_2=The Resistance researcher still needs more mutated white animal specimens to examine. Go find another species with this abnormality and bring it back.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q470/DONE=The mutated specimens you recovered proved that the state of the environment is actually far better than previously believed. Considering that humanity's return might undo all of these gains, the researcher expressed doubt about what is truly best for the planet.
PAUSE_ENEMY_006b=This humanoid, Goliath-class machine lifeform is actually a colony of smaller machines that uses their combined energy to move one massive body.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q410_END_1=When told of 11B's escape plan, 16D mockingly recalls how hideously strict 11B had been with her. Now, she says, she can happily devote herself to her work. She looks delighted as she says it.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q410_END_2=You decided not to tell 16D about 11B's escape plans. 16D admits she was in a relationship with 11B, and she has decided to convert herself into a combat android to avenge 11B's death.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q020/RUN_1_US=The machine lifeform known as Jean-Paul lives in Pascal's Village and speaks in byzantine philosophical passages. Talking to him proved a frustrating\u2014and fruitless\u2014endeavor, so speak to his female admirers to learn more about him.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q020/RUN_2_US=A woman in Pascal's village explained that Jean-Paul has additional followers in the amusement park and desert. Find these two fans, then give their presents to Jean-Paul.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q020/RUN_3_US=Jean-Paul seemed rather...nonplussed about the gifts. Go tell the three fans how he responded.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q020/CLR_US=Despite being rejected by Jean-Paul, his followers made no attempt to see him for what he truly was. As Jean-Paul also had no interest in understanding his followers, he began to question the overall meaning of the relationship.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q020/DONE_US=After visiting Jean-Paul again, you learned that he left a letter behind before departing on a journey. He devoted himself to philosophy to the very end, never once taking notice of those who held affection for him.
PAUSE_ENEMY_2010_US=This Jean-Paul fan from Pascal's village, whose face is covered with a heavy coat of paint, regards the philosopher as someone who knows everything. She claims to be a female machine model, serving as proof that gender exists among their kind. After writing a letter to Jean-Paul, she was told he had no desire to reply\u2014a response that inexplicably made her happy.
PAUSE_ENEMY_2020_US=This brightly decorated Jean-Paul fan from the amusement park regards the philosopher as cool and mysterious. She considers another of Jean-Paul's fans, living in the desert, to be her mortal enemy. She presented Jean-Paul with a gift of beautiful glass, only to have him reject it as a useless trinket\u2014a response that inexplicably made her happy.
PAUSE_ENEMY_2030_US=This Jean-Paul fan from the desert, who wears clothing that reflects her view of the world, regards the philosopher as a passionate and inquiring mind. She also possesses a keen sense of smell, going so far as to sniff out the fact that 2B and 9S came from Pascal's village. She presented Jean-Paul with a machine fossil, only to have him reject it as a trash\u2014a response that inexplicably made her happy.
PAUSE_QUEST_HELP_Q032/FIN=Through his talks with 9S and 2B, Engels came to realize the severity of his sins. Already at the end of his life span, he decided that death would be the best option.
