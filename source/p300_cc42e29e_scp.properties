M3060_S0032_G0000_001_a9s=Devola? Popola?
M3060_S0032_G0010_001_a9s=What are you doing here!?
M3060_S0032_G0020_001_dbl=Remember your promise?
M3060_S0032_G0030_001_a9s=What are you talking about?
M3060_S0032_G0040_001_ppl=Come on, 9S! Hack in while you can!
M3060_S0032_G0050_001_a9s=None of this makes any sense!
M3060_S0032_G0060_001_ppl=We'll explain everything once we're inside!
M3060_S0032_G0070_001_a9s=Ugh!
M3060_S0032_G0071_001_a9s=No... We can't just abandon them!
M3060_S0032_G0072_001_a9s=If we don't do something, they're gonna...
M3060_S0032_G0073_001_pod153=Alert: Leaving the zone of combat would mean abandoning the androids Devola and Popola.
M3060_S0032_G0074_001_pod153=Proposal: Hack into the main Tower unit.
M3060_S0032_G0200_300_dbl=Where are you going, 9S? We need you!
M3060_S0032_G0210_300_ppl=9S, come back! We can't hold out by ourselves!
M3060_S0032_G0220_300_pod153=Alert: Enemy forces gathering around Devola and Popola. Situation critical.
M3060_S0032_G0230_300_pod153=Proposal: Provide rescue support immediately.
M3060_S0032_G0240_300_a9s=I can't leave them alone... I've got to go back!
M3060_S0032_G0250_300_dbl=Damn... Looks like this is it.
M3060_S0032_G0260_300_ppl=No...
M3060_S0032_G0270_300_dbl=We've got this, 9S! You just focus on hacking!
M3060_S0032_G0280_300_dbl=You need to hack the Tower lock open!
M3060_S0032_G0290_300_ppl=9S! You must hack into the Tower!
M3060_S0032_G0300_300_ppl=We...we can't hold out like this!
M3060_S0032_G0310_300_dbl=9S! I can't do this anymore!
M3060_S0032_G0320_300_ppl=Aaaaugh!
