M1050_S0005_G0000_001_op60=2B, this is Operator 6O.
M1050_S0005_G0001_001_a9s=Back this way again? What a pain.
M1050_S0005_G0002_001_a2b=Stop complaining.
M1050_S0005_G0003_001_a9s=Yeah, yeah.
M1050_S0005_G0010_001_op60=We now have an operational transporter in the city ruins.
M1050_S0005_G0010_300_jackas=You should be able to zap yourself here from other transporters now.
M1050_S0005_G0011_300_jackas=You're certainly...active in a lot of areas, aren't you?
M1050_S0005_G0012_300_jackas=Shut the hell up. \n...You'll make me blush.
M1050_S0005_G0020_001_op60=We're attempting to deploy them at other points as well.
M1050_S0005_G0030_001_a9s=About time we had access to those!
M1050_S0005_G0040_001_a2b=Care to fill me in?
M1050_S0005_G0050_001_a9s=Transporters? They let you transfer your consciousness to a temporary body back in the Bunker.
M1050_S0005_G0060_001_a9s=I heard some tech guys talking about it a while ago, but I didn't know they'd finally got it working.
M1050_S0005_G0070_001_a9s=Anyway, I'll mark the positional data on the map.
M1050_S0005_G0071_001_jackas=Hey. How's it hangin'?
M1050_S0005_G0072_001_a2b=You again...
M1050_S0005_G0073_001_jackas=Your commander told me to build a new access point, so...here ya go.
M1050_S0005_G0074_001_jackas=Oh, and I got the stupid transporter up and running too.
M1050_S0005_G0075_001_a9s=Um, thank you?
M1050_S0005_G0076_001_jackas=I've known the Commander for a while now. She sure is good at pawning work off on people.
M1050_S0005_G0077_001_jackas=Next time you see her, give her some lip for me, will ya?
M1050_S0005_G0080_001_a2b=So this has a transporter now, huh?
M1050_S0005_G0100_001_a9s=Still, transporters ARE pretty handy!
M1050_S0005_G0110_001_a9s=They're WAY faster than flight units when it comes to travelling between Earth and the Bunker.
M1050_S0005_G0120_001_a9s=Flight units also leave us open to attack, and they're expensive to operate, too.
