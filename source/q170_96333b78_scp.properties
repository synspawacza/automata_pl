M5170_S0000_G0000_300_op60=Thanks in advance for handling that transporter repair.
M5170_S0010_G0000_001_op60=Operator 6O to 2B. Come in, 2B.
M5170_S0010_G0010_001_a2b=I read you, Operator. Go ahead.
M5170_S0010_G0020_001_op60=It looks like the transporter we installed in the city ruins has gone offline.
M5170_S0010_G0030_001_op60=Our surface activity is going to be severely limited until we get it fixed.
M5170_S0010_G0040_001_op60=Can you head over there and get it working again when you have a sec?
M5170_S0010_G0050_001_a2b=Will do.
M5170_S0010_G0060_001_op60=Thanks, 2B! Sending the details now.
M5170_S0020_G0000_001_pod042=Analysis: Non-functioning transporters can result in serious limitations to data uploading and other vital mission activities.
M5170_S0020_G0010_001_pod042=Recommend repairing transporter as quickly as possible.
M5170_S0020_G0020_001_a2b=Understood.
M5170_S0020_G0030_001_pod042=Alert: Hostile machine lifeforms detected in the vicinity of the non-functioning transporter. Jamming signals detected.
M5170_S0020_G0040_001_pod042=Hypothesis: Transporter malfunction is due to enemy jamming signals.
M5170_S0020_G0050_001_pod042=Proposal: Unit 2B should destroy the enemy machines.
M5170_S0030_G0000_001_a2b=Is that all of them?
M5170_S0030_G0010_001_a2b=Let's check this thing out.
M5170_S0030_G0020_001_a2b=I don't see any damage.
M5170_S0030_G0021_001_pod042=Analysis: Transporter is now operational.
M5170_S0030_G0030_001_a2b=This is YoRHa unit 2B. Connect me to Bunker Operator 6O.
M5170_S0030_G0040_001_op60=Oh, hello, 2B! Operator 6O here.
M5170_S0030_G0050_001_a2b=The transporter was being jammed by machine lifeforms. It should be working now.
M5170_S0030_G0060_001_op60=Looks green on my end, 2B. Nice work!
M5170_S0030_G0070_001_op60=I'll let Command know right away.
M5170_S0030_G0080_001_op60=I'll also be sending over a little reward for all your hard work.
M5170_S0030_G0090_001_a2b=Roger.
M5170_S0030_G0100_001_op60=You know, 2B? I'm a little jealous.
M5170_S0030_G0110_001_op60=Don't get me wrong\u2014I know all this fighting isn't easy for you.
M5170_S0030_G0120_001_op60=But you get to see all these new and amazing things out there...
M5170_S0030_G0130_001_op60=It just...it might be nice to visit the surface sometime, you know? That's all.
M5170_S0030_G0140_001_a2b=I see.
M5170_S0030_G0150_001_op60=Er, right. Apologies for the unnecessary chatter.
M5170_S0030_G0160_001_op60=Anyway. Operator 6O out!
M5920_S0010_G0180_001_pod042=Report: Mail notification received from access point.
