M1010_S0010_G0000_300_a9s=2B, can you hear me? I'm starting your boot sequence.
M1010_S0010_G0010_300_a9s=First, you'll want to check your brightness settings.
M1010_S0010_G0020_300_a9s=...Hmm? You don't know how to adjust the brightness? I think it's set up to respond to some kind of input.
M1010_S0010_G0030_300_a9s=Er, all right. Just give me a second here...
M1010_S0010_G0040_300_a9s=Okay, I found the guide! If you can just follow that, it'll make things easier.
M1010_S0010_G0050_300_a9s=Right then. Let's get started.
M1010_S0010_G0060_300_a9s=We'll go through each adjustment in order.
M1010_S0010_G0070_300_a9s=Let's start by getting the brightness set.
M1010_S0010_G0080_300_a9s=Okay. How does this look?
M1010_S0010_G0090_300_a2b=Okay
M1010_S0010_G0100_300_a9s=Roger that.
M1010_S0010_G0110_300_a2b=Not good
M1010_S0010_G0120_300_a9s=Oh, and I should probably let you know that this entire process is being recorded for posterity.
M1010_S0010_G0130_300_a9s=Now let's take a look at your voice recognition settings.
M1010_S0010_G0140_300_a9s=Seems your voice recognition is set to mute, which isn't gonna work. I'm gonna call out to you now\u2014make sure you can hear my voice.
M1010_S0010_G0150_300_a9s=Ma'am? Are you there? Can you hear me?
M1010_S0010_G0160_300_a9s=Uh, hellooo? Go ahead and adjust your settings so you can hear me, all right?
M1010_S0010_G0170_300_a9s=Adjust the settings until you can hear my voice.
M1010_S0010_G0180_300_a9s=Er, could you try and pick up the pace a little bit? This is getting embarrassing...
M1010_S0010_G0190_300_a9s=Wait, you shouldn't be able to hear me now...
M1010_S0010_G0200_300_a9s=All right. Are we good now?
M1010_S0010_G0220_300_a9s=Okay! Settings should all be good to go.
M1010_S0010_G0240_300_a2b=I'm fine, 9S. There's something calming about your voice.
M1010_S0010_G0250_300_a9s=Oh, uh, th-thank you! ...Anyway, that takes care of the settings.
M1010_S0010_G0260_300_a9s=Ngh!? What the heck? My pulse rate is rising!
M1010_S0010_G0270_300_a9s=Hmm... It seems to be back to normal now. How odd.
M1010_S0010_G0280_300_a9s=Er, hold on. Your self-destruct permissions are missing.\nWait a sec, we need to restore those.
M1010_S0010_G0290_300_a9s=I could set it for you, but you should probably do it yourself. Regulations and all, you know?
M1010_S0010_G0300_300_a9s=Huh? Wait, no. You need to leave that turned on.
M1010_S0010_G0310_300_a9s=Yeah, you can't really do that. It needs to be turned on except in very specific cases.
M1010_S0010_G0320_300_a9s=I'm afraid I can't leave this as-is, ma'am. Please give your permission.
M1010_S0010_G0330_300_a9s=Hey, come on now! I'm just trying to follow regulations here.
M1010_S0010_G0340_300_a9s=Okay, good. If things go wrong during an op, you may have to sacrifice yourself in order to finish it, sooo...
M1010_S0010_G0360_300_a9s=Once you're finished making adjustments, you can go ahead and close this out.
M1010_S0010_G0370_300_a9s=Oh, I see you've turned vibration detection on. Let's run a check to make sure it's working.
M1010_S0010_G0380_300_a9s=I'm gonna tap you on the shoulders, all right?
M1010_S0010_G0390_300_a9s=How was that? Did you feel it?
M1010_S0010_G0410_300_a9s=Okay, check complete.
M1010_S0010_G0420_300_a9s=Huh? That's odd. Everything should be set up correctly.
M1010_S0010_G0430_300_a9s=Here, let me try somewhere else. I'm gonna tap you on the arm this time, okay?
M1010_S0010_G0440_300_a9s=Did you feel that?
M1010_S0010_G0460_300_a9s=Okay, check complete.
M1010_S0010_G0480_300_a9s=Huh? Really?
M1010_S0010_G0490_300_a9s=2B must have felt that... Maybe she's just messing with me.
M1010_S0010_G0500_300_a9s=Well, if you say so. How about this?
M1010_S0010_G0510_300_a9s=Should I tap her here, though? She might get angry at me.
M1010_S0010_G0520_300_a9s=Er, how was that?
M1010_S0010_G0540_300_a9s=Okay, check complete.
M1010_S0010_G0560_300_a9s=Are you serious?
M1010_S0010_G0570_300_a9s=You didn't feel anything just now?
M1010_S0010_G0580_300_a9s=Well then, let's try something else.
M1010_S0010_G0590_300_a9s=No turning back now, I guess...
M1010_S0010_G0600_300_a9s=...Well?
M1010_S0010_G0620_300_a9s=Okay, great. Thanks.
M1010_S0010_G0640_300_a9s=Hmm... I don't know what's causing this, so we'll need to run some precision diagnostics later.
M1010_S0010_G0650_300_a9s=Regardless, that's the end of the check for now.
M1010_S0010_G0660_300_a9s=I know no one LIKES the idea of self-destructing.
M1010_S0010_G0670_300_a9s=But that's what regulations call for. Still, I'll keep it a secret from the Commander.
M1010_S0010_G0680_300_a9s=You...don't want to hear my voice? I mean, it's your choice and all, but...
M1010_S0010_G0690_300_a9s=You undid the settings I walked you through...
M1010_S0010_G0700_300_a9s=Er, this isn't about me, is it? Because I'm really hoping we'll be a good team going forward.
M4100_S0000_G0000_300_sele=Yes
M4100_S0000_G0010_300_sele=No
