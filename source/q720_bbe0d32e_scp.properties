M5590_S0050_G0150_001_pod153=The hostile machine lifeforms have been defeated.
M5720_S0010_G0000_001_resiman=Have you seen these folks, perchance?
M5720_S0010_G0010_001_a9s=Hmm... Nope, sorry.
M5720_S0010_G0020_001_resiman=They were part of my squad, but I lost contact when they went out for field research. If anything has happened to them...
M5720_S0010_G0030_001_resiman=Well, to put it bluntly...if they're dead, I need to know so I can mourn them properly.
M5720_S0010_G0040_001_a9s=Have you tried searching for them?
M5720_S0010_G0050_001_resiman=I'd go myself, but my motor systems were heavily damaged some time back.
M5720_S0010_G0060_001_resiman=Still, I just can't stop wondering what happened...
M5720_S0010_G0070_001_sele=Help with the search.
M5720_S0010_G0080_001_sele=Decline the request.
M5720_S0010_G0090_001_resiman=I understand. Sorry to spring this on you.
M5720_S0010_G0100_001_resiman=I want to search for them, but I can't abandon my work here...
M5720_S0010_G0110_001_a9s=I'll look for them.
M5720_S0010_G0120_001_resiman=You will?
M5720_S0010_G0130_001_a9s=Sure. Can you give me an idea where to start?
M5720_S0010_G0140_001_resiman=Last time I heard from them, they were in the flooded city.
M5720_S0010_G0141_001_resiman=I'll give you their ID codes. We all wield dual weapons, so you should be able to find them easily.
M5720_S0010_G0150_001_resiman=If they're dead, I'd appreciate if you could retrieve any personal articles you find.
M5720_S0010_G0190_001_resiman=I lost contact with my friends in the flooded city. If they're dead, could you please retrieve their personal items for me?
M5720_S0010_G0195_001_resiman=They were carrying two weapons, so they should be easy enough to spot.
M5720_S0020_G0000_001_pod153=Alert: This is one of the Resistance members we were asked to locate.
M5720_S0020_G0000_300_resiman=I appreciate the help.
M5720_S0020_G0001_300_resiman=So he didn't make it, huh?
M5720_S0020_G0002_300_resiman=You picked up other signals as well, right? The others might still be alive... Could you go and help them, please?
M5720_S0020_G0010_001_a9s=I was afraid we'd find this.
M5720_S0020_G0020_001_a9s=The only personal items are these dog tags...
M5720_S0020_G0030_001_a9s=Analysis: Remaining transmission records indicate the Resistance members were attempting to retreat from battle.

M5720_S0020_G0050_001_a9s=Let's go take a look. Maybe some of them will still be alive.

M5720_S0020_G0070_001_pod153=No vital signs detected. The unit is deceased.
M5720_S0020_G0080_001_a9s=Man, there's blood everywhere. Whatever happened must've happened right here.
M5720_S0020_G0090_001_a9s=Talk about a bad way to go...
M5720_S0020_G0100_001_pod153=Alert: Emergency support request found in transmission records.
M5720_S0020_G0110_001_a9s=When was it sent?
M5720_S0020_G0120_001_pod153=Approximately twelve minutes ago.
M5720_S0020_G0130_001_a9s=That means they're still alive. Let's go!
M5720_S0020_G0140_001_a9s=Over there! Initiating rescue!
M5720_S0020_G0150_001_robolarge=REVENGE! CLAIM YOUR REVENGE!
M5720_S0020_G0160_001_robomedium=Avenge the pain of our comrades!
M5720_S0020_G0170_001_robosmall=I HATE ANDROIDS! HATE THEM!
M5720_S0020_G0180_001_robolarge=SEIZE THEM! KILL THEM! DESTROY THEM ALL!
M5720_S0020_G0190_001_robomedium=Violence rules this world! Violence is all!
M5720_S0020_G0200_001_robosmall=KILL EACH AND EVERY ONE!
M5720_S0020_G0210_001_robolarge=TEAR APART THOSE WHO RESIST US!
M5720_S0020_G0220_001_robomedium=Kill! Kill! Kill kill KILL KILL!
M5720_S0020_G0230_001_robosmall=BURN THEM TO DEATH! CRUSH THEM TO DEATH!
M5720_S0020_G0240_001_robolarge=DRAIN THEIR BLOOD! EVERY DROP!
M5720_S0020_G0250_001_robomedium=Another sacrifice for the altar!
M5720_S0020_G0260_001_robosmall=I FEEL SO...SO ALIVE!
M5720_S0020_G0270_001_robolarge=YOU WILL DIE WRITHING IN PAAAAAAIN!
M5720_S0020_G0280_001_robomedium=All hail the machines!
M5720_S0020_G0290_001_robosmall=GYA HA HA HA HAAAAAA!
M5720_S0020_G0300_001_robolarge=EEEEE HEE HEE!
M5720_S0020_G0310_001_pod153=Alert: This is one of the Resistance members we were asked to locate.
M5720_S0020_G0320_001_pod153=No vital signs detected. The unit is deceased.
M5720_S0020_G0330_001_a9s=Damn...
M5720_S0020_G0340_001_pod153=Analysis: All missing Resistance members are deceased.
M5720_S0020_G0350_001_a9s=I suppose we'd better return their belongings.
M5720_S0030_G0000_001_resiman=...Your face tells me everything I need to know. They didn't make it, did they?
M5720_S0030_G0010_001_a9s=No. I'm sorry.
M5720_S0030_G0020_001_resiman=I...see.
M5720_S0030_G0030_001_a9s=This is what's left of their personal effects.
M5720_S0030_G0040_001_resiman=Thank you.
M5720_S0030_G0050_001_resiman=Now I'll just place these flowers with them...
M5720_S0030_G0060_001_a9s=Er, flowers?
M5720_S0030_G0070_001_resiman=Ah, yeah, I'm just imitating an old ritual.
M5720_S0030_G0080_001_resiman=The human race had many traditions when it came to mourning their dead. I know that may not mean much to us, but...
M5720_S0030_G0090_001_resiman=Well, I just want their souls to find some peace. That's the wish I'm putting into these flowers, at any rate.
M5720_S0030_G0100_001_resiman=Thank you again for your help.
M5720_S0030_G0110_001_resiman=Can I admit something? I'm...relieved that I was too injured to fight.
M5720_S0030_G0120_001_resiman=I'm relieved because it allowed me to escape.
M5720_S0030_G0130_001_resiman=Was there something I could have done?
M5720_S0030_G0140_001_a9s=A tradition of mourning the dead...
M5720_S0030_G0150_001_a9s=2B...
M5720_S0030_G0160_001_a9s=2B.
M5720_S0030_G0170_001_a9s=I'm not quite sure what it means to mourn, or even if we have a soul to concern ourselves with...
M5720_S0030_G0180_001_a9s=But I hope you're at rest, 2B. Sweet dreams.
M5720_S0030_G0190_001_a9s=I'll be with you before long.
M5920_S0020_G0280_001_pod153=Target location data obtained. Marking on map.
