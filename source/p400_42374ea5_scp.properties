M5095_S0300_G0000_001_n02=Phew. Organizing all these records sure isn't easy.
M5095_S0300_G0010_001_n02=I'm busting my can doing overtime every single day.
M5095_S0300_G0020_001_n02=Lessee, what do we have today? Hmm... Plato 1728, eh?
M5095_S0300_G0030_001_n02=Oh yeah, I remember. That's the guy who went haywire.
M5095_S0300_G0100_001_n02=Well, that wraps up all of the record keeping for this place.
M5095_S0300_G0110_001_n02=Ummm... Where was I supposed to go next again?
M5095_S0300_G0120_001_n02=Oh yeah, the server room.
M5095_S0300_G0130_001_n02=That place is so stuffy. I hate it there.
M5095_S0300_G0140_001_n02=Hmmm, where was my terminal again?
M5095_S0300_G0150_001_n02=Oh, here it is.
M6150_S0145_G0000_001_juniorR=Oh hello, Senpai!! Wait, don't tell me... \nYou're on your way to the server room, right?
M6150_S0145_G0010_001_juniorR=See! I knew it!\nThe server room is right up ahead, you can't miss it!
M6150_S0145_G0020_001_juniorR=I just started working here today, and they put me in charge of guidance and traffic regulation! Lookin' forward to workin' with ya, Senpai!
M6150_S0145_G0030_001_juniorR=This place is like a maze, so the management department is being flooded with complaints! Now that I'm here though, you'll have nothing to worry about!
