SUPPORT_WORD_01_000=I bet you're having a tough time right now.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_001=Shooters are tough.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_002=I've walked the same road as you.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_003=It was hard for me as well.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_004=You'll die many times before it's over.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_005=Let's calm down for a moment.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_006=There's always next time!
SUPPORT_WORD_01_007=Your eyes get tired, don't they?
SUPPORT_WORD_01_008=I thought it would never end.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_009=I know what you want to say.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_010=I saw this through to the end.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_011=It'd be amazing if you cleared this alone.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_012=Step up as many times as it takes!
SUPPORT_WORD_01_013=If you give up, you're done for.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_014=I thought it was some kind of mistake.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_015=Good results must be earned.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_016=Are you really giving up here?
SUPPORT_WORD_01_017=How many continues is this?
SUPPORT_WORD_01_018=Have you realized how weak you are?
SUPPORT_WORD_01_019=You were zoning out there!
SUPPORT_WORD_01_020=There's no trick to this.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_021=What are you doing?
SUPPORT_WORD_01_022=Having fun?
SUPPORT_WORD_01_023=What if you get cornered?
SUPPORT_WORD_01_024=Not everyone in this world plays fair.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_025=2B and 9S put their lives on the line.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_026=This world is rife with hardship.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_027=The bullets rain down without pause.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_028=This is an unwinnable fight.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_029=What you're playing now is a mere game.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_030=It's just a game in the end, right?
SUPPORT_WORD_01_031=It's sad, but things don't always work out.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_032=You're thinking this is impossible, right?
SUPPORT_WORD_01_033=Sometimes you just feel trapped.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_034=You were so close to winning that last fight.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_035=Shitty world, shitty game!
SUPPORT_WORD_01_036=I did my best.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_037=No one will help you.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_038=You are one who knows fear.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_039=Lose, lose, and lose some more!
SUPPORT_WORD_01_040=Sometimes you forget what it means to live.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_041=I've always heard games are "just for fun."
SUPPORT_WORD_01_042=Does this battle have meaning?
SUPPORT_WORD_01_043=The real world is naught but hardship.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_044=My voice may not reach you.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_045=I'm serious, even if it's just a game!
SUPPORT_WORD_01_046=Do you like this game?
SUPPORT_WORD_01_047=I love this game!
SUPPORT_WORD_01_048=You must decide what it means to exist.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_049=I may not have the right to say this.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_050=Your growth hinges on your resolve.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_051=Limits exist to be broken!
SUPPORT_WORD_01_052=You're surrounded by enemies.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_053=Do you care for this worthless world?
SUPPORT_WORD_01_054=Is there an answer at the end of this battle?
SUPPORT_WORD_01_055=Throw yourself into a battle with no end.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_056=You are alone.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_057=Is this the fight you wanted?
SUPPORT_WORD_01_058=Do you think help is on the way?
SUPPORT_WORD_01_059=Are you at your wit's end?
SUPPORT_WORD_01_060=Feel like running away?
SUPPORT_WORD_01_061=I won't give up!
SUPPORT_WORD_01_062=You'd love to go home already, wouldn't you?
SUPPORT_WORD_01_063=You and I are the same.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_064=Who are you?
SUPPORT_WORD_01_065=Your shoulders are tense. Relaaaaax.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_066=Help isn't coming.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_067=Any juice left in your batteries?
SUPPORT_WORD_01_068=How long do you plan to continue?
SUPPORT_WORD_01_069=I've had my share of hardship.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_070=You're holding up well.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_071=Haven't you just about had enough?
SUPPORT_WORD_01_072=You did your best.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_073=You must be exhausted.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_074=You're weak!
SUPPORT_WORD_01_075=Can you see the light of hope?
SUPPORT_WORD_01_076=There is nothing but despair.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_077=I'm confident in my shooting abilities.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_078=I'm not a strong shooter.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_079=I like 2B!
SUPPORT_WORD_01_080=I like 9S!
SUPPORT_WORD_01_081=I like A2!
SUPPORT_WORD_01_082=I like Emil!
SUPPORT_WORD_01_083=I'm a Popola fan!
SUPPORT_WORD_01_084=I'm a Devola fan!
SUPPORT_WORD_01_085=Some wars never end.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_086=Tomorrow is my day off.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_087=Wait, tomorrow's MONDAY!?
SUPPORT_WORD_01_088=Haven't given up yet?
SUPPORT_WORD_01_089=You're tough.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_090=Are you alone?
SUPPORT_WORD_01_091=The fight was everything.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_092=Can you really keep going?
SUPPORT_WORD_01_093=Oh, come on! No one told me about this!
SUPPORT_WORD_01_094=I'm not done yet!
SUPPORT_WORD_01_095=Push yourself beyond your limits.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_096=Cut your way through!
SUPPORT_WORD_01_097=You can't fight on an empty stomach.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_098=I'm sure *you* can handle this.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_099=That all you've got?
SUPPORT_WORD_01_100=You'd think so, wouldn't you?
SUPPORT_WORD_01_101=The struggle must continue.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_102=Are you tired?
SUPPORT_WORD_01_103=Love and hate are two sides of the same coin.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_104=We're not that different, you and I.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_105=Do not avert your eyes from difficulties.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_106=Who needs sleep anyway?
SUPPORT_WORD_01_107=Negative.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_108=Affirmative.
SUPPORT_WORD_01_109=Proposal:
SUPPORT_WORD_02_000=In any case,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_001=On top of that,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_002=Instead,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_003=In the end,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_004=But,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_005=But
SUPPORT_WORD_02_006=But...
SUPPORT_WORD_02_007=If not,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_008=Otherwise,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_009=If not, then
SUPPORT_WORD_02_010=What's more,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_011=However,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_012=Moreover,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_013=If so,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_014=Therefore,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_015=Well,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_016=Or, rather,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_017=Namely,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_018=At least
SUPPORT_WORD_02_019=Then, after that,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_020=Doing so,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_021=If you don't,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_022=Not really, but...
SUPPORT_WORD_02_023=If that's the case,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_024=If that's not so, then
SUPPORT_WORD_02_025=Er, I mean,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_026=Otherwise,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_027=Wait, no, I mean
SUPPORT_WORD_02_028=That being said,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_029=That reminds me,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_030=So, then,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_031=Then
SUPPORT_WORD_02_032=And, also,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_033=As an alternative, 
SUPPORT_WORD_02_034=For that purpose,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_035=As a result,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_036=After that,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_037=And also,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_038=In that case,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_039=So, 
SUPPORT_WORD_02_040=Despite that,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_041=Because of that,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_042=All the same,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_043=At the same time,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_044=Even so,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_045=And thus we can say,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_046=In addition,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_047=And yet,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_048=Nevertheless,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_049=In addition to that,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_050=Not only that,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_051=But that's not all;
SUPPORT_WORD_02_052=That aside,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_053=Putting that aside,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_054=Because of this,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_055=As such,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_056=So
SUPPORT_WORD_02_057=While it may be so,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_058=Or
SUPPORT_WORD_02_059=But even so,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_060=But still,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_061=Still,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_062=In which case, 
SUPPORT_WORD_02_063=I mean,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_064=If that's true,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_065=Given that,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_066=In spite of that,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_067=By the way,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_068=Incidentally,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_069=What I mean is...
SUPPORT_WORD_02_070=Though,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_071=And thus,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_072=Nonetheless,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_073=What I mean to say is,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_074=If that weren't the case,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_075=Now then,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_076=But, even so,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_077=Or should I say,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_078=Or rather,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_079=Yet,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_080=Anyway, 
SUPPORT_WORD_02_081=Either way,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_082=At any rate,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_083=Having said that,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_084=Be that as it may,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_085=And yet, still,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_086=Why? Because
SUPPORT_WORD_02_087=Despite this,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_088=If that's the truth, 
SUPPORT_WORD_02_089=Notwithstanding,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_090=Which leads us to:
SUPPORT_WORD_02_091=And remember,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_092=Also,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_093=Or, you could say
SUPPORT_WORD_02_094=Rather,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_095=Just remember,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_096=Thus,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_097=On the other hand,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_098=On the contrary,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_099=Specifically,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_100=In other words,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_101=Actually,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_102=Don't make excuses;
SUPPORT_WORD_02_103=That said, 
SUPPORT_WORD_02_104=In particular,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_105=Conversely,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_106=Basically,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_107=To give an example,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_108=With that in mind,
SUPPORT_WORD_02_109=The feeling is:
SUPPORT_WORD_02_110=One thing is certain:
SUPPORT_WORD_03_000=become the wind, like Emil!
SUPPORT_WORD_03_001=it'll work out if you stay calm.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_002=get wild, like 2B!
SUPPORT_WORD_03_003=fight for what's important to you!
SUPPORT_WORD_03_004=scream if you need to!
SUPPORT_WORD_03_005=suffering makes people grow.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_006=I'll give it all I've got!
SUPPORT_WORD_03_007=let's enjoy this!
SUPPORT_WORD_03_008=you should do your best, too!
SUPPORT_WORD_03_009=how about trying to go a little farther?
SUPPORT_WORD_03_010=show me what you're made of!
SUPPORT_WORD_03_011=don't give up here!
SUPPORT_WORD_03_012=it's fun!
SUPPORT_WORD_03_013=let's share in our joy!
SUPPORT_WORD_03_014=never surrender!
SUPPORT_WORD_03_015=keep going!
SUPPORT_WORD_03_016=the whole world is rooting for you.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_017=we've got this!
SUPPORT_WORD_03_018=you'll be fine if you stay calm.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_019=stay optimistic.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_020=let's see how this really ends.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_021=the night has just begun.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_022=I'm in your corner.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_023=don't throw your life away.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_024=you've got us with you.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_025=keep trying for just a biiiit longer!
SUPPORT_WORD_03_026=we should be able to get further.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_027=effort will be rewarded.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_028=I want to help you.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_029=try to stay cool.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_030=try to relax.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_031=there's light at the end of the tunnel.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_032=you're not the only one.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_033=I'm rooting for you.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_034=don't give in to temptation!
SUPPORT_WORD_03_035=rely on your own strength!
SUPPORT_WORD_03_036=give it one more go.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_037=take a breather.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_038=keep going for now.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_039=believe in yourself.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_040=there's still a long way to go.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_041=if you won't do it, who will?
SUPPORT_WORD_03_042=don't lose your nerve!
SUPPORT_WORD_03_043=break a leg!
SUPPORT_WORD_03_044=you can do it if you try!
SUPPORT_WORD_03_045=push through in one go!
SUPPORT_WORD_03_046=there's nothing to worry about!
SUPPORT_WORD_03_047=full steam ahead!
SUPPORT_WORD_03_048=it's all right.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_049=everything will be fine!
SUPPORT_WORD_03_050=take it one step at a time.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_051=it's OK to take a break.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_052=don't push yourself.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_053=take your time remembering.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_054=let us share in our joy!
SUPPORT_WORD_03_055=let's calm down.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_056=hang on just a bit longer!
SUPPORT_WORD_03_057=I can keep going.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_058=never give up the struggle!
SUPPORT_WORD_03_059=just do better next time.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_060=let someone else play for you.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_061=there's no way you can do it.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_062=you'll reach the end of your rope.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_063=you're worthless.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_064=you lost. Let it go.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_065=it's already over.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_066=it's just a game. Face reality already!
SUPPORT_WORD_03_067=surrender.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_068=just forget it.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_069=it's meaningless.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_070=you're wasting your time.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_071=why not head home?
SUPPORT_WORD_03_072=turn the power off.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_073=you're not needed.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_074=give up the game.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_075=disappear.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_076=you can just put down the controller.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_077=you're worthless.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_078=go look for something else to enjoy.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_079=it's stupid to continue this nonsense.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_080=why not just stop already?
SUPPORT_WORD_03_081=this game is crap anyway.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_082=I hate PlatinumGames!
SUPPORT_WORD_03_083=just stop playing if you're that bad.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_084=even in video games, you're useless.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_085=it's time to return to the real world.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_086=it's not like you hate it, right?
SUPPORT_WORD_03_087=solitude makes people stronger.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_088=it's a game. Go wild!
SUPPORT_WORD_03_089=I feel the same.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_090=can you avert your eyes and walk away?
SUPPORT_WORD_03_091=you need to know when to give up.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_092=I'm starving.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_093=let's sacrifice ourselves.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_094=I feel a finger cramp coming on.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_095=let's have some candy.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_096=let's live in solitude.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_097=I've given up.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_098=wallow in despair!
SUPPORT_WORD_03_099=glory to mankind!
SUPPORT_WORD_03_100=don't stay up too late.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_101=rules exist so we can know our freedoms.
SUPPORT_WORD_03_102=I've got my eyes on you.
